1
00:00:13,60 --> 00:00:14,49
It's got to be

2
00:00:14,49 --> 00:00:19,68
a friend. You know its title and it was
created. I think it's entertainment.

3
00:00:21,74 --> 00:00:27,70
I live gave welcome to lecture two
of some it's an essay that i think

4
00:00:28,72 --> 00:00:35,48
you sort of track you like.
Just before we start. I

5
00:00:35,49 --> 00:00:41,30
reiterate interviews he's in need
to be thinking about that now

6
00:00:42,51 --> 00:00:46,58
less likely to be done and
bob. Life is going to take

7
00:00:46,58 --> 00:00:52,71
a lot of pressure off right. So newsgroups
please think about your interviews you

8
00:00:52,71 --> 00:00:58,09
get to say obvious prevent it is to
some of you know civil superiors thirty

9
00:00:58,09 --> 00:01:04,08
lecturing parents and. Figure previously
designed and delivered as you know. So it

10
00:01:04,08 --> 00:01:10,17
is going to do it for me. Interesting
insights for you now i'm sure i'm sure some

11
00:01:10,17 --> 00:01:14,48
many of you know teachers and researchers
in social media especially certainly and

12
00:01:14,48 --> 00:01:19,98
i think this year or so from this year an
academic focus and innovation presented

13
00:01:19,98 --> 00:01:26,72
which is investing better for our
entrepreneurs process system.

14
00:01:26,74 --> 00:01:33,46
industry today's topic social media but
when you think about the threat to the

15
00:01:33,46 --> 00:01:40,28
technology. We think of novel digital
technology safely or no this

16
00:01:40,28 --> 00:01:45,10
is operating change the way people people
interact and they can do so directly

17
00:01:45,10 --> 00:01:48,91
business opportunities on the on the
supply side and to do. Looking at

18
00:01:48,91 --> 00:01:53,47
a new service if you businesses on that
on the demand side and to use in cost and

19
00:01:53,47 --> 00:01:58,56
improving services and within the category
therefore not the top amenity technology

20
00:01:58,56 --> 00:02:04,07
so proud of my social and today
we're going to look at social media

21
00:02:05,37 --> 00:02:10,21
social media enables us to communicate
it interact and break with partners

22
00:02:10,21 --> 00:02:16,18
customers and stakeholders can't so build
an aversion. Thank you. No relation

23
00:02:17,22 --> 00:02:21,72
to comments in an organization and soup is
going to give us an appreciation of the

24
00:02:21,72 --> 00:02:27,24
country. What we can accept
i guess thank you stuart.

25
00:02:29,18 --> 00:02:33,75
I guess i'm just going to share some of
things that i actually do within what i do

26
00:02:36,01 --> 00:02:40,12
this you need is actually quite interesting
because how involved was actually early

27
00:02:40,12 --> 00:02:43,93
it was all about at the ccs and privacy
and then it morphed into professional

28
00:02:43,93 --> 00:02:50,64
services and i guess it's it's it's
cooked up or it's actually down on the

29
00:02:50,64 --> 00:02:53,36
basis of how professional
suppression actually

30
00:02:53,36 --> 00:03:00,03
t industrial and how you go students
would understand the industrial practice

31
00:03:00,03 --> 00:03:06,65
outside. If it helps to shape
form change your career.

32
00:03:07,73 --> 00:03:10,19
And the guess lectures
would probably serve as

33
00:03:10,19 --> 00:03:15,72
a. I guess some example of something
which is being done outside and you can

34
00:03:15,72 --> 00:03:21,81
actually take some pointers from that to
the i've got i'm going to show you about

35
00:03:21,81 --> 00:03:25,61
social media analytics
or analysis which is

36
00:03:25,61 --> 00:03:30,59
a big part of my career and so.

37
00:03:33,81 --> 00:03:38,42
And you can sort of question me
any time you want right. And

38
00:03:43,93 --> 00:03:50,81
ok so some background. I look at it all
concerned when i've been like ten years

39
00:03:50,81 --> 00:03:56,96
at seven. So this is my 10th year. I joined
in 2007 from you know still long gone.

40
00:03:57,12 --> 00:04:02,45
So i've been in industrial school academic
industry for a while now. I research

41
00:04:02,45 --> 00:04:09,13
a range of technology
related areas and i do some

42
00:04:09,13 --> 00:04:15,46
consultation on casual basis so if someone
asked me what's my expertise i probably

43
00:04:15,46 --> 00:04:17,41
take a probably tell them social media

44
00:04:17,41 --> 00:04:22,65
a range of social media issues
from choosing platforms on mobile.

45
00:04:24,32 --> 00:04:30,41
Should you go highbridge if you go native
to do web applications online customer

46
00:04:30,41 --> 00:04:37,00
behavior tracking someone behavior
online. What would they do

47
00:04:37,00 --> 00:04:40,12
what kind of cliques. Try to analyze

48
00:04:40,12 --> 00:04:46,15
a server log analysis see what they're up
to i did my page here on their actually

49
00:04:48,44 --> 00:04:55,36
and big data strategy. We talked about
i used these days. Internal things and

50
00:04:55,36 --> 00:05:00,76
so actually huge seamless pervasive.
You find you can actually track people

51
00:05:02,49 --> 00:05:09,08
around the city of melbourne has gone
wireless you get an alright that's

52
00:05:09,08 --> 00:05:13,04
a phrase you won't find throughout the
city you know the whole thing can be

53
00:05:13,04 --> 00:05:18,35
actually tracked all your phones
would appear as a mac address like

54
00:05:18,35 --> 00:05:24,98
a dot on an aerial view map. And you can
track your movements wherever you want to

55
00:05:24,98 --> 00:05:29,49
success in rather sexist points just examples
of things that you could actually do

56
00:05:29,49 --> 00:05:36,27
in. So for the background.
So what they do get there.

57
00:05:37,76 --> 00:05:43,82
Started with some accounting. Like on things
to complete the counting. Matt wasn't

58
00:05:43,82 --> 00:05:50,02
the best thing to do that some
computer science editor doing honest.

59
00:05:51,57 --> 00:05:58,32
So program something like seek don't
come in 1986 that i did my own volition

60
00:05:58,32 --> 00:06:04,54
using lotus notes then worked on internet
addictive web sites in ninety nine.

61
00:06:06,11 --> 00:06:09,25
Theses ringmasters and then it appeared in

62
00:06:09,25 --> 00:06:14,96
a i feel as my background. Studies.
Can produce i'm working on

63
00:06:16,10 --> 00:06:22,69
a trade anorexia on twitter. May not project.
So you might have actually heard the

64
00:06:22,69 --> 00:06:27,50
project it's probably been winding
down. It's annoying but that's

65
00:06:27,51 --> 00:06:34,27
a violation for the disabled. Using
smart devices for improving functional

66
00:06:35,15 --> 00:06:40,54
. I guess ability so we can
impact. So this using smart came

67
00:06:42,13 --> 00:06:47,70
mobile phone and triangulating that data
with feedback seeing where they are

68
00:06:47,70 --> 00:06:51,64
stressed and where they're not stressing
it so that. Because we can empower people

69
00:06:51,64 --> 00:06:56,89
can actually see far they've got their
division but this might can actually helps

70
00:06:56,89 --> 00:07:03,04
to track. Sorry infrared objects
which are in front so want them with

71
00:07:03,04 --> 00:07:08,13
a vibration on their hand. So they know
there's something in front but sometimes

72
00:07:08,13 --> 00:07:12,53
they can't handle the stress of because
they can't see saw the fifth beatle

73
00:07:12,53 --> 00:07:18,57
actually pick up the stress and send
signals to control station for example and

74
00:07:18,58 --> 00:07:19,77
over time we can produce

75
00:07:19,77 --> 00:07:25,45
a heat map of where troublesome areas are
in the city where disabled people can't

76
00:07:25,45 --> 00:07:31,48
actually move around which is impeding
them more and then you can solve this. And

77
00:07:31,48 --> 00:07:37,58
the camel actually snap photos images of
which areas trouble spots sort of what are

78
00:07:37,58 --> 00:07:44,55
they facing this sort of
triangulation of data and other

79
00:07:44,55 --> 00:07:50,35
work is actually with the worse it
takes analytics. We're sort of out the

80
00:07:52,15 --> 00:07:58,00
that and the age where we could actually
almost do biometric analysis of person

81
00:07:58,00 --> 00:08:03,80
wants. So if i get you to talk for
ten minutes and then i let you know

82
00:08:03,80 --> 00:08:08,26
a crowd of 200 people and all of you talk
i can still pinpoint and tell you that's

83
00:08:08,26 --> 00:08:15,00
very well in the club because
we're trying to do those things.

84
00:08:16,08 --> 00:08:20,34
Yeah so that's my project that's
sort of my dictation and so on

85
00:08:24,67 --> 00:08:30,86
i guess this is my early approach. I
guess where i am right now i find to see

86
00:08:31,63 --> 00:08:35,98
if when i guess we all want to be professional.
So sometimes. How do you how do you

87
00:08:35,98 --> 00:08:41,88
actually calling yourselves a professional
people see a range of things of course

88
00:08:41,88 --> 00:08:46,72
a fix not being ethical understanding and
i would things i think this actually

89
00:08:46,72 --> 00:08:53,47
helps in my case productive me being
innovative whatever you do you find

90
00:08:53,47 --> 00:08:55,96
somewhere assigned a mechanism

91
00:08:55,96 --> 00:09:00,44
a methodology to increase efficiency
or end to improve you work assertive

92
00:09:00,44 --> 00:09:05,91
communication positive social network
management and this i find is actually

93
00:09:05,91 --> 00:09:07,08
extremely important as

94
00:09:07,08 --> 00:09:13,10
a lead now but probably been doing this
for what fifteen seventeen years. I find

95
00:09:13,10 --> 00:09:19,72
that i actually do this better managing
social networks. I guess all of us are part

96
00:09:19,72 --> 00:09:23,44
of social media. Right. We all got an
overseer problem. Linked in your facebook.

97
00:09:24,46 --> 00:09:28,59
You got twitter tumblr into grand whatever
that is and you got professional friends

98
00:09:31,37 --> 00:09:36,07
but this management of friends is
actually increasingly becoming important

99
00:09:38,46 --> 00:09:42,41
and i find that i get balance when i
actually do social and charity work so that

100
00:09:42,41 --> 00:09:48,54
makes me sort of complete. And it's not
always chasing financial gains and money

101
00:09:50,49 --> 00:09:56,90
. Right. I'll get to what i
do so. One of the topics

102
00:09:56,90 --> 00:09:58,59
a social member announces that i have

103
00:09:58,59 --> 00:10:05,31
a shirt. Now all of your facebook
or twitter. Everyone is yeah yeah

104
00:10:05,31 --> 00:10:07,65
yeah it is

105
00:10:07,66 --> 00:10:13,59
a fun. Good. Yeah sort of you get
engaged with people and so on

106
00:10:14,74 --> 00:10:20,79
my traction to this domain is actually why
some of it. Some of the campaigns for

107
00:10:20,79 --> 00:10:26,67
example. I'm very successful. Why some
campaigns are not successful. You know early

108
00:10:26,67 --> 00:10:26,73
on

109
00:10:26,73 --> 00:10:32,73
a product for it. For example why certain
things become the big kid and why some doesn't

110
00:10:32,73 --> 00:10:33,42
and is

111
00:10:33,42 --> 00:10:40,13
a benefit or disadvantage or advantage
and this is my attraction to that to the

112
00:10:40,13 --> 00:10:46,81
doorway to this dog. So i find i

113
00:10:46,81 --> 00:10:52,62
help to understand the science behind
why some things fail. So there is

114
00:10:52,62 --> 00:10:57,86
a great example of something fairly
qantas. So some some of you are probably

115
00:10:58,62 --> 00:11:03,49
familiar with this is happening 2011 when
qantas was trying to rebrand themselves

116
00:11:03,49 --> 00:11:09,45
and improve services.
Talking about qantas luxury

117
00:11:11,50 --> 00:11:15,35
never said you can you know
you win a free ticket if like

118
00:11:15,35 --> 00:11:20,26
a somewhat few tweets something
interesting and you find people tweeting

119
00:11:20,26 --> 00:11:27,11
a lot of interesting things five airports
for flights and only one law they want to

120
00:11:27,11 --> 00:11:28,94
luxury in saying it's

121
00:11:28,94 --> 00:11:35,92
a negative way of things training. This

122
00:11:35,92 --> 00:11:42,90
more recently two years ago. You know
texas tech's industry. I mean this

123
00:11:42,90 --> 00:11:49,85
is how when pretty badly. This
is pretty good when i had to

124
00:11:49,85 --> 00:11:56,32
go to that will because
my fallacy. I guess.

125
00:11:58,12 --> 00:12:04,48
That campaign anticipates as this or so to
be premature. There are some things that

126
00:12:04,48 --> 00:12:08,54
they were not doing but then they wanted
to jump on social media bandwagon. So

127
00:12:08,55 --> 00:12:13,56
there's certain rules with social media
and. When big companies fail to understand

128
00:12:13,56 --> 00:12:18,24
i approach this with the media
sort of seeing in the wrong way.

129
00:12:23,15 --> 00:12:27,38
Ok. Now this is such a small
camping a real head of

130
00:12:27,38 --> 00:12:34,03
a car called roadster but we're not you
know clancy or opposing this i'm going to

131
00:12:34,03 --> 00:12:34,17
run

132
00:12:34,17 --> 00:12:38,44
a youtube clip just assure you i was sometimes
some companies getting really right

133
00:12:38,44 --> 00:12:45,24
and and what's what. And this is
interesting. Let's see what they ask the

134
00:12:45,24 --> 00:12:45,79
users to do

135
00:12:45,79 --> 00:12:53,86
a very

136
00:12:53,87 --> 00:13:00,71
absurd. Interesting thing
for twelve seconds to

137
00:13:00,71 --> 00:13:07,67
strip in public to win

138
00:13:07,67 --> 00:13:07,97
a cup

139
00:13:52,42 --> 00:13:52,42
.

140
00:14:57,06 --> 00:15:04,06
Ok. I don't want to you know
one winner. Yeah. So part

141
00:15:04,06 --> 00:15:08,42
of my role is actually when i get to. When
i get called up this actually trying to

142
00:15:08,42 --> 00:15:12,70
investigate west a tipping point.
Why certain things become such

143
00:15:12,70 --> 00:15:14,56
a school and wanting some doesn't so it's

144
00:15:14,56 --> 00:15:17,39
a science to it. So it's not just running

145
00:15:17,39 --> 00:15:21,06
a campaign and everything throw some money
and then. Oh yeah it actually works.

146
00:15:21,09 --> 00:15:23,06
It's not like that social media has

147
00:15:23,91 --> 00:15:29,77
a certain intimation seven tries. It's
even wheels that you've got to turn for it

148
00:15:29,77 --> 00:15:35,67
to actually make happen. So i don't like

149
00:15:40,21 --> 00:15:44,23
it is. The luckiest sort
of actually ingenue in

150
00:15:44,23 --> 00:15:48,92
a lot of ways and and the
public eye is actually like

151
00:15:48,92 --> 00:15:54,83
a love i mean at the back of the bag and
in june and then generally it's all about

152
00:15:54,83 --> 00:15:58,01
analytics and trying to actually get the
right. People get the right movement

153
00:15:58,90 --> 00:16:03,33
getting your formula right at least you
know when you fail you know what was the

154
00:16:03,33 --> 00:16:07,98
outcome and where you could have actually
modified what for you to get but then the

155
00:16:07,98 --> 00:16:10,41
thing is you don't want to bad p.r.

156
00:16:10,41 --> 00:16:17,18
Mission like your taxes or qantas
or some some campaigns like

157
00:16:17,18 --> 00:16:19,29
etsy. So makers have got

158
00:16:19,29 --> 00:16:24,20
a bad campaign. So you don't want that
thing to happen for the possible. She's

159
00:16:24,20 --> 00:16:30,87
going to contain. You know so i
guess social media is actually

160
00:16:30,87 --> 00:16:34,92
big and there's a lot of
in things into it and as

161
00:16:34,92 --> 00:16:39,56
a professional for me. If someone asked
me why roadster was actually successful

162
00:16:39,56 --> 00:16:43,40
then you have to go back and see what they've
done six months before starting. Just

163
00:16:43,40 --> 00:16:48,03
then start running a campaign in the
last two weeks and you know when

164
00:16:48,03 --> 00:16:54,46
a car has got straight. They think it will
do they care to annika you know might

165
00:16:54,46 --> 00:16:59,81
feel like no. Instead. But
yeah you know interesting.

166
00:17:01,76 --> 00:17:06,22
All right so it's so social media
analytics actually big it's huge. There's

167
00:17:06,22 --> 00:17:10,48
a lot of things in there and it's a it's

168
00:17:10,48 --> 00:17:15,36
a big topic. So we've got profile trying
to understand who is coming to the side of

169
00:17:15,36 --> 00:17:20,70
who's your audience was reading the
size of the audience. Content analysis

170
00:17:22,34 --> 00:17:26,67
compatibly benchmarking is people responding.
One can arrest once you're giving

171
00:17:27,74 --> 00:17:32,18
sentiment analysis positive negative.
You know sentiment discontent and

172
00:17:32,18 --> 00:17:38,04
disengagement and traffic flow trying to
look at traffic lights and velocity of

173
00:17:38,04 --> 00:17:43,14
information coming in. Vera citya information
coming in right here being patient

174
00:17:43,14 --> 00:17:48,68
coming in to reach any grief and
how people have more of a topic on

175
00:17:48,68 --> 00:17:54,65
a set that you release in the public and
how is it morphed into something else i

176
00:17:54,66 --> 00:18:00,78
all familiar with a subgroup. Social
media to read it from yet in there is

177
00:18:00,78 --> 00:18:07,67
a lot of sobriety and so on. So you
actually more things and so on. So you find

178
00:18:07,67 --> 00:18:08,77
that it actually does

179
00:18:08,77 --> 00:18:12,73
a lot of things to be able to say so. She's
so big it's actually huge money in an

180
00:18:12,73 --> 00:18:19,28
army of people working
on this. And there's

181
00:18:19,28 --> 00:18:24,03
a couple of things that are actually very
familiar with that box that you sort of

182
00:18:24,03 --> 00:18:27,91
actually look at and see you know so what
are we doing what are we really doing

183
00:18:27,91 --> 00:18:34,44
where we are at the point of
looking at so things and.

184
00:18:35,02 --> 00:18:39,59
For companies to actually think there are
we would like to know suddenly let's

185
00:18:39,59 --> 00:18:44,84
estrangement certainly think that ok. I
think we need to spend some time and get on

186
00:18:44,84 --> 00:18:49,99
twitter more actively for example they
don't stand who's on twitter and who's

187
00:18:49,99 --> 00:18:56,77
engaging on twitter for them
or who talks about higher ed i

188
00:18:56,77 --> 00:19:01,64
had occasion within social
media in that field.

189
00:19:04,30 --> 00:19:04,76
Other despots

190
00:19:07,64 --> 00:19:13,37
a lot of the time for companies mess
out is actually trying to analyze

191
00:19:15,59 --> 00:19:20,33
data and forget what is actually happening
around them. What's happening around

192
00:19:20,33 --> 00:19:26,36
them is actually big data. So there's
different definitions of big data but.

193
00:19:27,27 --> 00:19:33,62
If you can break it up to this very
volume the lost city. Alrighty and resti

194
00:19:33,62 --> 00:19:39,53
and you find each one of their mansions
of people differently for each platform.

195
00:19:40,66 --> 00:19:45,24
So facebook for example you find the wall
you more discussion might mutually reach

196
00:19:47,13 --> 00:19:50,69
but there were lots of things not that
reach as completely twitter for example

197
00:19:50,69 --> 00:19:57,62
because its rhetoric like an iraqi
structured unstructured data you

198
00:19:57,62 --> 00:19:58,29
get images

199
00:19:59,36 --> 00:20:06,19
a lot of other things on facebook
compacted twitter. And this

200
00:20:07,02 --> 00:20:10,80
integrity of data the veracity of data.
How do you actually verify a data as

201
00:20:10,80 --> 00:20:17,76
a should correct. And this has
been an issue with all know

202
00:20:17,76 --> 00:20:22,52
that especially police and so
on so recent recent approach by

203
00:20:26,03 --> 00:20:32,15
police for example is trying to reach out
to the public in trying to get help in

204
00:20:32,16 --> 00:20:36,09
2011 and 2009 we had

205
00:20:36,09 --> 00:20:42,81
a black saturday fires in victoria. So
i was analysing twitter feed on like

206
00:20:42,81 --> 00:20:49,18
something. A year after that
queensland police called me out to

207
00:20:49,18 --> 00:20:53,57
present in brisbane trying to help them to
actually frame how we can actually track

208
00:20:54,95 --> 00:20:59,38
social media ports with regards to fires
bushfires especially trying to tackle the

209
00:20:59,38 --> 00:21:05,80
recipe problems and you find that it's not
an easy to not it's not an easy task but

210
00:21:05,80 --> 00:21:12,74
then with enough data right now like with
what we've got right now. Mobiles make

211
00:21:12,74 --> 00:21:19,66
a dressers and phones and i am ii
numbers connected. You know where

212
00:21:19,66 --> 00:21:25,28
you actually make any phone calls or
release information to public you find you

213
00:21:25,28 --> 00:21:31,21
could do actually sort of an intelligent
triangulation of data. To verify if

214
00:21:31,21 --> 00:21:35,80
someone actually has pranked or someone
not given an actual information

215
00:21:39,93 --> 00:21:43,58
other advances are folks armful in america
if you call name on one which is the

216
00:21:43,58 --> 00:21:48,69
major sea hotline and you don't actually
get through. Let's say you make

217
00:21:48,69 --> 00:21:54,32
a call on the call went through but the
person receiving the call. Couldn't

218
00:21:54,32 --> 00:22:00,70
actually hear anything and the phone
cuts of. They can find you. Within

219
00:22:00,70 --> 00:22:07,62
a hundred meter square. They can look at
you just using amplifying tellers the

220
00:22:07,63 --> 00:22:09,74
nearest to phone towers
to actually receive

221
00:22:09,74 --> 00:22:13,86
a call could actually look at
you so i guess a lot of there's

222
00:22:13,86 --> 00:22:17,88
a lot of technology where you can actually
get back and to verify this actually

223
00:22:17,88 --> 00:22:23,56
actual problem happening or a disaster
area and things so that so there's

224
00:22:23,57 --> 00:22:28,93
a range of these very
progress in this area so. For

225
00:22:28,93 --> 00:22:35,23
a company trying to solve this is not
easy. Yes of course. And you find.

226
00:22:38,53 --> 00:22:44,42
Trying to get sentiments when your velocity
side or trying to flee handle data is

227
00:22:44,42 --> 00:22:49,79
actually an interesting challenge.
Especially when they goes like this.

228
00:22:51,98 --> 00:22:56,17
So you got started later is actually pretty
simple like tax rate you can actually

229
00:22:56,17 --> 00:23:02,37
mining in finding within semi structure
you find that you can't do predictive

230
00:23:03,39 --> 00:23:10,32
studies too much. So criminality
this is part of the australians for

231
00:23:10,32 --> 00:23:10,74
example

232
00:23:10,74 --> 00:23:15,68
a very sarcastic with the words our level
of sarcasm is actually very very high

233
00:23:15,68 --> 00:23:22,21
compared to other cultures. So we have
tried analysing using the american

234
00:23:22,21 --> 00:23:27,11
text for the australian industry and it
doesn't work. It doesn't fit that well

235
00:23:30,41 --> 00:23:36,86
it is quite interesting actually. Yes we
know creating this corpus the australian

236
00:23:36,86 --> 00:23:40,30
copies of language for
example. And i'm such

237
00:23:40,30 --> 00:23:44,31
a very dear. So we may tell
you. Neater and so on.

238
00:23:48,00 --> 00:23:48,31
So there's

239
00:23:48,31 --> 00:23:55,15
a company called cio ranks and they work
with telstra the melbourne company and so

240
00:23:55,15 --> 00:24:01,20
ciara exactly does analyzing all of
these leaders exhaustingly using be

241
00:24:01,20 --> 00:24:08,03
a tools and intelligent
agencies always talk to them

242
00:24:08,03 --> 00:24:14,31
with regards to acquiring information i
can actually mine that for any reasons

243
00:24:15,51 --> 00:24:21,67
various reasons. So these are some of
the things that i actually encounter to

244
00:24:21,67 --> 00:24:26,51
actually within this doctrine and in

245
00:24:26,52 --> 00:24:33,08
a range of industries. So from health care.
Security traffic control manufacturing

246
00:24:34,52 --> 00:24:41,46
searching yes training telling
congress multi sales arrangement.

247
00:24:45,88 --> 00:24:49,64
Any fine big great a sort
of actually seeping into

248
00:24:49,64 --> 00:24:56,52
a range of domains and industries
and apple geisha nsw. So if

249
00:24:56,52 --> 00:25:01,48
you are very keen with regards to social
media and the let's now see so analytics

250
00:25:01,48 --> 00:25:02,21
you find there's

251
00:25:02,21 --> 00:25:07,50
a great platter of application that you
could actually put yourself through to land

252
00:25:07,50 --> 00:25:13,05
in any of these areas i guess.

253
00:25:14,63 --> 00:25:19,69
One key thing in doing what i do is
actually trying to understand customer

254
00:25:19,70 --> 00:25:23,05
touchpoint or customer
journey this data bank so

255
00:25:23,05 --> 00:25:29,15
a lot of companies call it customer take
sixty of you. So you probably know this is

256
00:25:29,15 --> 00:25:33,13
literally from where a customer
would get to know a product or

257
00:25:33,13 --> 00:25:38,69
a brand or hear about them and then go
to the journey of where's consideration

258
00:25:38,70 --> 00:25:39,30
which is

259
00:25:39,30 --> 00:25:45,79
a service and loyalty. You probably would
have seen this in marketing. Thanks

260
00:25:45,79 --> 00:25:51,60
mark. Make them thanks. Basically every
time you go through this cycle of anything

261
00:25:51,60 --> 00:25:55,57
you know everything you've got technology
touch points where customers would

262
00:25:55,57 --> 00:26:01,35
actually leave footprints and for companies
to collect footprints of this would

263
00:26:01,35 --> 00:26:03,99
prince and create a digital proxy of

264
00:26:03,99 --> 00:26:09,17
a person. So this could be called

265
00:26:10,64 --> 00:26:15,78
a company to find out about that and i and
the company collect your voice to text

266
00:26:17,87 --> 00:26:24,85
cancellation for example collecting
your biometric so they're with such

267
00:26:24,85 --> 00:26:26,49
a secure site you go to

268
00:26:26,49 --> 00:26:31,74
a site your server log analysis and you
eyepiece collected their faithful. Or you

269
00:26:31,74 --> 00:26:38,66
go to twitter or any other ads. You
click and your e-mail might be

270
00:26:38,66 --> 00:26:44,91
connected with google for example and all
of you know google reach your email twice

271
00:26:44,91 --> 00:26:51,26
a day. Yes. So it's all computer red so

272
00:26:52,08 --> 00:26:58,91
and all all what all what google does
is actually look for keywords with all

273
00:26:58,91 --> 00:27:04,96
the marketing companies they are actually
connected with so companies who want to

274
00:27:04,96 --> 00:27:09,88
present or want to sell things will actually
have keywords and those keywords will

275
00:27:09,88 --> 00:27:14,94
be on google to try to map it to your email
and if any of those keywords actually

276
00:27:14,94 --> 00:27:17,76
match then you other possible than

277
00:27:17,76 --> 00:27:22,69
a red target. So when you go to youtube
or you else. One of the banner ads will

278
00:27:22,69 --> 00:27:28,49
actually pop up. So it's all sort of
intelligent systems ecosystems like it's all

279
00:27:28,49 --> 00:27:34,72
connected together and so the company
actually buys information from google with

280
00:27:34,72 --> 00:27:41,39
regards to your e-mail or your browsing
behavior or anything aside you find that

281
00:27:41,39 --> 00:27:47,42
your proxy which was initially nothing
over time will slowly become you

282
00:27:49,68 --> 00:27:55,22
over time using either cookies or your
phone your email any distraction that you

283
00:27:55,22 --> 00:28:01,34
could actually do. I'm not sure if this
is connected to your loyalty cards but i

284
00:28:02,04 --> 00:28:07,30
called and woolworths and everybody every
want all doing the same to try and

285
00:28:07,30 --> 00:28:12,46
actually predict what you buy. Next try
and understand what we should do next is

286
00:28:12,47 --> 00:28:17,37
it's sort of actually helping
the sales and marketing

287
00:28:20,27 --> 00:28:27,10
. So when you do. When you understand
customer touch points you can actually sort

288
00:28:27,10 --> 00:28:34,10
of plan your channels. So
your channels will be in

289
00:28:36,11 --> 00:28:41,67
your absence which stalls you
come from. Wherever you go

290
00:28:43,72 --> 00:28:50,68
the websites that you want can't
use section and so on and

291
00:28:50,69 --> 00:28:52,58
for for

292
00:28:52,59 --> 00:28:57,78
a company the moment they could actually
serve us an omni channel because i guess

293
00:28:57,78 --> 00:29:04,19
customers we often look for convenience
and we look for what i say

294
00:29:05,39 --> 00:29:10,27
with end of season so on these
days. We find ourselves

295
00:29:12,65 --> 00:29:18,75
constantly going to its convenience rather
than actually putting the card in for.

296
00:29:19,07 --> 00:29:22,84
For example buying something
we just pay with right. For

297
00:29:22,84 --> 00:29:24,98
a paper and that's using an

298
00:29:24,98 --> 00:29:31,87
a c. So those sort of convenience would
actually lead to omnichannel marketing

299
00:29:31,88 --> 00:29:38,67
and services delivery and you find customers
actually actually you know sort of

300
00:29:38,67 --> 00:29:42,84
actually improve the experience with regards
to buying behavior but then there's

301
00:29:42,84 --> 00:29:47,40
a lot of information which actually captured
behind some nothing bad i'm less just

302
00:29:47,40 --> 00:29:53,94
saying that's how the trend
is this less. It's not me

303
00:29:53,94 --> 00:29:59,97
being in this industry is actually trying
to find out right. What kind of customers

304
00:29:59,97 --> 00:30:01,46
do you have so you're talking to

305
00:30:01,46 --> 00:30:07,57
a horse trailer for example how do you
actually send your product or send packaging

306
00:30:07,57 --> 00:30:14,54
or letters to regional australia or
anywhere. And what they do right

307
00:30:14,54 --> 00:30:18,08
now you say actually they've got contractors
rather than they themselves are

308
00:30:18,08 --> 00:30:23,78
actually sending so you find their brands
are not actually carried on austria falls

309
00:30:23,78 --> 00:30:27,33
brand it's not actually carried on. I
mean contractors have got their own

310
00:30:27,33 --> 00:30:31,00
agreements with regards to delivery and
their model delivery and how they actually

311
00:30:31,00 --> 00:30:36,71
make money. So you've got all this
different existing competing commercial

312
00:30:36,71 --> 00:30:40,24
agreements. And of course

313
00:30:40,24 --> 00:30:45,69
a very it's nature of mobile and technology
which is actually getting huge effect

314
00:30:45,69 --> 00:30:50,23
mantid you find that if you
want to go back and service

315
00:30:50,23 --> 00:30:54,59
a customer with one channel. So actually
very challenging you would have fifty

316
00:30:54,59 --> 00:30:58,80
customers and all of them would be using
different phones and so one kind of mobile

317
00:30:58,80 --> 00:31:01,04
app would you create would you
create a native would you create

318
00:31:01,04 --> 00:31:02,97
a hybrid or to create

319
00:31:02,97 --> 00:31:09,58
a web application and so this other typical
questions that you need to answer and

320
00:31:09,59 --> 00:31:14,02
try to find out which is actually worth
while without costing them too much but

321
00:31:14,02 --> 00:31:19,93
then improve efficiency. Alright sometimes

322
00:31:21,25 --> 00:31:26,98
you get like this. So someone.
Are you familiar with this. Yeah

323
00:31:34,32 --> 00:31:41,27
you know i guess what does
it say i don't tolerate

324
00:31:42,11 --> 00:31:46,50
a lot. Yeah yeah yeah you know. So it's
actually a server log analysis i see

325
00:31:46,50 --> 00:31:52,12
a log. So part of analyzing is
actually trying to understand

326
00:31:54,59 --> 00:32:01,44
what they are you actually getting
from. And various ways of actually how

327
00:32:01,44 --> 00:32:08,27
technology actually works. So if you
know how. How any requests on his ship

328
00:32:08,27 --> 00:32:12,15
you're using into that actually works.
Basically every time you ask for

329
00:32:12,15 --> 00:32:16,90
a page or you type of google
dot com or the age dot com not

330
00:32:16,90 --> 00:32:21,68
a whatever the race the
age server will receive

331
00:32:21,68 --> 00:32:27,71
a request from your machine your mobile
or your left alone. Whatever. And then it

332
00:32:27,71 --> 00:32:29,51
says yes we do

333
00:32:29,51 --> 00:32:35,88
a handshake good and old releases
speech for you and your eyepiece. Taken

334
00:32:36,71 --> 00:32:40,24
all connected track for
example. So every time

335
00:32:40,24 --> 00:32:43,10
a request is made and i
please. You know your i.p.

336
00:32:43,10 --> 00:32:48,02
Is released and that's actually tracked by
the server which is actually giving you

337
00:32:48,02 --> 00:32:53,61
a page. So what information you
get from there is basically

338
00:32:55,66 --> 00:33:02,57
all the time on freak whereas
time or service give an eye.

339
00:33:03,64 --> 00:33:08,07
What mattered was used down
the size referring you

340
00:33:08,07 --> 00:33:12,07
r hour and so on and if i know

341
00:33:12,07 --> 00:33:16,91
a time in your machine. If you have
been those who would have actually

342
00:33:16,91 --> 00:33:17,83
a file called cookie

343
00:33:17,83 --> 00:33:24,44
a phone to call cookie and you have some
information in there and then connecting

344
00:33:24,44 --> 00:33:31,43
all this behind. And getting all

345
00:33:31,43 --> 00:33:32,93
this information you can actually produce

346
00:33:32,93 --> 00:33:37,10
a profile of someone of
the usa from an a.p.

347
00:33:37,10 --> 00:33:40,35
Right. And you can build

348
00:33:40,35 --> 00:33:46,99
a presence profile from just
that and sometimes actually

349
00:33:46,99 --> 00:33:52,84
hard to understand what is going on. So as

350
00:33:52,85 --> 00:33:59,23
a researcher. I find myself technology's
not actually advancing to quickly and i'm

351
00:33:59,23 --> 00:34:03,67
actually getting behind. I finds
a challenge actually being

352
00:34:03,67 --> 00:34:07,70
a professional within social media analysis
and who do i turn to out to all these

353
00:34:08,52 --> 00:34:15,04
different people sarah runs
free free courses online. It's

354
00:34:15,95 --> 00:34:20,39
provided by ivy league universities.
It's for free right despite of massively

355
00:34:20,39 --> 00:34:27,27
online. Open your name courses
youtube for all these people

356
00:34:27,27 --> 00:34:33,22
you can actually. Request for service.
And you find any project that comes out

357
00:34:34,25 --> 00:34:38,12
also actually has demanded. If i don't have
the skills are sexy. Someone else could

358
00:34:38,12 --> 00:34:43,22
actually do it for me or could actually
help do it. I'm not suggesting that you

359
00:34:43,22 --> 00:34:48,52
should actually outsource your assignment.
But what i'm saying is you could

360
00:34:48,52 --> 00:34:54,86
actually get help to improve your
skills in such and i mean. So sort of

361
00:34:54,86 --> 00:34:58,26
a look. Analysis for example was initially
really hard trying to understand what

362
00:34:58,26 --> 00:35:03,07
was going on and then different types of
service but later to have after getting

363
00:35:03,07 --> 00:35:09,12
some help and some courses online. It
wasn't that hard to find that the need for

364
00:35:09,82 --> 00:35:16,75
devil of learn this industry is actually
constant and it's something that you would

365
00:35:16,75 --> 00:35:22,34
probably face throughout and it's ongoing.

366
00:35:24,24 --> 00:35:29,11
Ok so i sort of actually done the intro
part of social media analysis i'm going to

367
00:35:29,11 --> 00:35:29,52
go to

368
00:35:29,52 --> 00:35:34,07
a project that i'm currently working and
i've got passion for someone she want to

369
00:35:34,07 --> 00:35:37,27
share that any questions. Yeah

370
00:35:43,90 --> 00:35:43,94
ok

371
00:35:51,64 --> 00:35:56,89
. Your friend. People like you.

372
00:36:00,20 --> 00:36:06,72
You know this one way. I guess this
few always write something like

373
00:36:07,70 --> 00:36:13,70
. So you tool that you know you are asking
what would companies want to from your

374
00:36:13,70 --> 00:36:19,89
right i guess is depending on what the
company is looking for if they're looking to

375
00:36:19,89 --> 00:36:20,45
let's say

376
00:36:20,45 --> 00:36:27,42
a profile of people who are disconnected
with facebook for example and

377
00:36:27,43 --> 00:36:28,99
they might take you as

378
00:36:28,99 --> 00:36:34,06
a prototypical profile in trying to
understand why this person is not engaging

379
00:36:35,19 --> 00:36:40,10
maybe any any type of person like this is
someone that we don't want to spend time

380
00:36:40,10 --> 00:36:42,42
on. So give an example of

381
00:36:42,42 --> 00:36:46,03
a person that they don't want to spend
time you know it could be like that.

382
00:36:47,17 --> 00:36:51,35
Depending i mean. So why do you have
facebook at all just to read other people's

383
00:36:51,35 --> 00:36:55,58
postings right. I get like

384
00:37:00,18 --> 00:37:06,30
yeah i guess so. Correct

385
00:37:07,79 --> 00:37:11,52
yeah but would you like it. What you would
you do like or what you do or do you

386
00:37:11,52 --> 00:37:17,98
just read and leave it. Oh
yeah ICT ok. Thank you so

387
00:37:17,99 --> 00:37:24,77
yeah i was exactly the same
as americans. You know

388
00:37:24,77 --> 00:37:31,64
trying to you know. Yes.
So he's trying to say that

389
00:37:33,97 --> 00:37:39,93
you know i never like coast to coast

390
00:37:41,88 --> 00:37:48,74
through it. So i suppose you
can understand privacy.

391
00:37:51,64 --> 00:37:56,03
I mean i mean anything that you drag all
your business. I don't something out of

392
00:37:56,03 --> 00:38:02,85
the norm. Well they're probably trying
to motivate you to use more features

393
00:38:02,85 --> 00:38:08,02
but helps. I find i just ten you maybe you
haven't allowed period of. You know an

394
00:38:08,02 --> 00:38:13,08
elective period i guess all the time but
anything you click can you track is

395
00:38:13,08 --> 00:38:17,13
actually once you click whatever you all
open up or you actually you browse it's

396
00:38:17,13 --> 00:38:19,31
all been collected as well.
Immaturity actually to

397
00:38:19,31 --> 00:38:24,86
a local or not. So you find some poor so
actually more liked by the people and

398
00:38:24,86 --> 00:38:31,33
that's been suggested you know the
domains. So i mean i guess you know what's

399
00:38:31,33 --> 00:38:36,87
happening with. What's up. Was bought by
facebook for nineteen billion dollars

400
00:38:38,78 --> 00:38:44,96
and so all the water use. And the
litigants and their techs annual digs and

401
00:38:44,96 --> 00:38:51,93
unstructured data all mind and those
technologies actually put into facebook. So

402
00:38:51,93 --> 00:38:58,64
all your message information is all been
tensions could be analysed. So police

403
00:38:58,64 --> 00:39:04,04
would require if you were exchanging
sensitive material or something and police

404
00:39:04,04 --> 00:39:09,44
would make requests to google or facebook
or anything and rebound to uses analytics

405
00:39:09,44 --> 00:39:16,16
to actually release information. So
make you question. How companies

406
00:39:16,17 --> 00:39:22,74
use this and it's depending
on what they want to do and.

407
00:39:23,65 --> 00:39:28,14
Companies as biggest facebook could actually
pose challenges to let's say it could

408
00:39:28,14 --> 00:39:29,61
could open up a competition to

409
00:39:29,61 --> 00:39:35,86
a few startups and say their own i've got
five million in active users can you make

410
00:39:35,86 --> 00:39:41,20
them active and they would actually find
something and if you get back to promote

411
00:39:41,20 --> 00:39:45,85
yeah that was something
i'm going to talk about

412
00:39:46,85 --> 00:39:51,67
a topic that i've been
working on about a year and

413
00:39:51,67 --> 00:39:57,28
a half now it's about
tracking anorexia on twitter.

414
00:39:59,00 --> 00:40:03,73
So it's growing very specific. So the
domain is only about twitter to analysis

415
00:40:03,73 --> 00:40:09,20
mining or to the data tracking thing so
they're going to question just put up your

416
00:40:09,20 --> 00:40:15,97
hand we can talk. All right
so protect unique in

417
00:40:17,24 --> 00:40:24,17
this particular project start of the beyond
blue because beyond blue. You've got to

418
00:40:24,17 --> 00:40:28,96
know what beyond do does so they work at
people who are depressed severely stressed

419
00:40:29,98 --> 00:40:34,42
and so we all do approach me to find
out if i could actually help them with

420
00:40:34,42 --> 00:40:41,23
self-harm and suicide prevention.
So whatever it someone is posting

421
00:40:41,23 --> 00:40:46,37
and we actually stressed. We do something
could be blue actually help them

422
00:40:46,37 --> 00:40:53,08
somewhere. So so the aim was to explore
social media. So it's actually

423
00:40:53,08 --> 00:40:53,75
huge right

424
00:40:53,75 --> 00:41:00,03
a lot of platforms traceable means so you
follow patterns trends and then observe

425
00:41:00,03 --> 00:41:06,44
social networks sentiment analysis
and things so that what i found was

426
00:41:06,44 --> 00:41:09,14
actually very hard it was

427
00:41:09,14 --> 00:41:14,18
a very big facebook twitter instagram
tumblr was that she was just too much. I

428
00:41:14,18 --> 00:41:20,15
couldn't do it and so i told them that
i'm just going to focus on one twitter

429
00:41:20,16 --> 00:41:22,27
because it's actually quite
easy in a peer. It's

430
00:41:22,27 --> 00:41:28,89
a big friendly so to do work in this
domain you need to understand how you can

431
00:41:28,89 --> 00:41:31,45
actually get data with facebook

432
00:41:31,45 --> 00:41:38,06
a peer facebook doesn't allow any historical
data instagram doesn't talk doesn't

433
00:41:38,06 --> 00:41:44,78
release any information at all. Tumblr
does not that friendly though. Twitter is

434
00:41:44,78 --> 00:41:49,07
gone but so you need to know where you can
get data from before you can actually

435
00:41:49,07 --> 00:41:55,38
analyze and actually do some work. And
because there's no funding so i had to opt

436
00:41:55,38 --> 00:42:01,44
out for sprinkler type of data from twitter
this firehose which is ninety percent

437
00:42:01,44 --> 00:42:05,36
of the data or free data which is called
sprinkler where you don't actually pay

438
00:42:05,36 --> 00:42:11,45
money but then you get but one to
two per cent of the data literally.

439
00:42:12,69 --> 00:42:18,43
So. And i told me all of this what we can
do. And let's try doing it and then the

440
00:42:18,43 --> 00:42:24,22
project started so for those who don't
understand eating disorders actually

441
00:42:24,22 --> 00:42:28,63
a big thing in australia
an eating disorder is also

442
00:42:28,63 --> 00:42:32,53
a precursor to suicide among
young australians. And this is

443
00:42:32,53 --> 00:42:38,57
a type of insiders you know. Believing
anorexia binge and weight loss dieting

444
00:42:40,69 --> 00:42:47,32
. And so eating disorders victory. We had
information so of sort of actually tap

445
00:42:47,32 --> 00:42:53,00
into their expertise and then
started tracking so it's actually

446
00:42:54,56 --> 00:42:59,74
if you go. If you know more about this area.
All this domain is actually called pro

447
00:42:59,74 --> 00:43:03,36
and so in a rockstar pro
anorexia. It's actually

448
00:43:03,36 --> 00:43:08,29
a subculture for anorexia and believe
me. And also on the web and.

449
00:43:10,04 --> 00:43:16,58
There makes all these people is
actually they've got views on got

450
00:43:16,58 --> 00:43:23,11
a different view on body image for
example and they take anorexia. It's

451
00:43:23,11 --> 00:43:30,02
a lifestyle choice. So these just want
to get them and that's what they go by

452
00:43:30,02 --> 00:43:35,61
doing it. And anyone time
in australia we've got

453
00:43:36,41 --> 00:43:43,00
a million people involved
in this. And it is it is

454
00:43:43,00 --> 00:43:48,89
a highly complex problem because
one in ten will surely die

455
00:43:48,89 --> 00:43:55,73
a ten percent death rate and four
out of ten would sort of never

456
00:43:55,73 --> 00:43:56,58
recover to see

457
00:43:56,58 --> 00:44:02,55
a huge burden on the health industry
certifying that if you look at the economics

458
00:44:02,55 --> 00:44:08,72
of it. It costs of trillion economy. You
can all make and social course is actually

459
00:44:08,72 --> 00:44:13,50
seventy billion a year and
total australian economy

460
00:44:14,19 --> 00:44:19,33
a year is actually one point three
trillion is a big chunk. It's

461
00:44:19,34 --> 00:44:26,22
a big chunk costing the state for
me. In australia by itself as

462
00:44:26,22 --> 00:44:32,14
soon as. We're not doing
much compact. The french

463
00:44:33,41 --> 00:44:36,29
in france with pride about say it's

464
00:44:36,29 --> 00:44:42,59
a bad recession criminal so it's an
offence for or for any side that same

465
00:44:42,59 --> 00:44:48,80
promises or creative type as actually
criminal charges as well as 20000

466
00:44:48,80 --> 00:44:52,08
euros fine that's well. So it's a it's

467
00:44:52,08 --> 00:44:59,01
a big impact but not in australia. So
not much has been done. So where my

468
00:44:59,01 --> 00:45:05,82
father research and practical
inversely linkage will is here. I

469
00:45:05,83 --> 00:45:09,61
guess eating disorders and social platforms
are huge. I'm just doing that but

470
00:45:12,56 --> 00:45:16,67
data available from clitoris i'm trying to
use all the information i could actually

471
00:45:16,67 --> 00:45:22,44
get and different types of outcomes.
What i can get from the data itself

472
00:45:24,15 --> 00:45:30,91
. Structured unstructured
data. Lings and mapping

473
00:45:32,15 --> 00:45:34,28
. So i guess i'm approaching it from

474
00:45:34,28 --> 00:45:40,61
a range of different types of methodologies
to get output and to see if someone

475
00:45:40,61 --> 00:45:45,83
promoting in iraq shia you know stray
liu someone gaining is their protrude

476
00:45:45,83 --> 00:45:52,75
behavior someone grooming someone else.
Some of the work that we do cross borders

477
00:45:52,75 --> 00:45:56,52
into police pedophilia sex workers there's

478
00:45:56,52 --> 00:45:59,85
a lot of other things they should
get involved. So it's sort of

479
00:45:59,85 --> 00:46:06,63
a sensitive area of information
within the tweets that you

480
00:46:06,63 --> 00:46:12,90
find eating disorder related to acts
technologies information so physical

481
00:46:12,90 --> 00:46:14,99
identification and you get

482
00:46:14,99 --> 00:46:19,69
a different thing. A because actually
global tracking and slighty. Other

483
00:46:19,69 --> 00:46:23,12
information and social networks. I guess

484
00:46:29,01 --> 00:46:29,20
it is

485
00:46:30,79 --> 00:46:36,51
a designer to therapy
accustomed to to get data.

486
00:46:37,75 --> 00:46:39,97
To whatever data to get
from twitter dump it into

487
00:46:39,97 --> 00:46:46,22
a cloud storage in rackspace called
rackspace in the states. It has twenty gig

488
00:46:47,28 --> 00:46:51,41
space at this time and then get
that to actually mine mine the data

489
00:46:56,74 --> 00:47:01,25
and. Part of the work is trying to find
out what kind of hashtags you actually

490
00:47:01,25 --> 00:47:08,09
follow for meme for example what morphs
into what. So you've got to follow and

491
00:47:08,09 --> 00:47:13,04
range of different things and it so this
creates this brings up all the big data

492
00:47:13,04 --> 00:47:17,56
issues complexity of what you're trying
to find out and what you're trying to

493
00:47:17,56 --> 00:47:23,13
actually. Because you

494
00:47:25,18 --> 00:47:31,66
know what the ratio of
people who bring in things

495
00:47:33,75 --> 00:47:34,22
you probably

496
00:47:41,88 --> 00:47:48,80
won't know you get so none of

497
00:47:48,80 --> 00:47:53,89
this actually get published. So it's
working with beyondblue and so my don't

498
00:47:53,89 --> 00:48:00,05
research institute and so on and this whole
public posts so i'm not crawling proper

499
00:48:00,05 --> 00:48:06,08
data. So what i'm doing is actually getting
what is out there and actually looking

500
00:48:06,08 --> 00:48:12,94
at the patterns within the information.

501
00:48:14,53 --> 00:48:19,70
Once you find if the behavior is actually
questionable. Then you've got all the

502
00:48:19,70 --> 00:48:23,68
rights to report to police. For example.
So they've got different arms are working

503
00:48:23,68 --> 00:48:28,58
on different things. I guess i'm actually
just being the intelligence side of

504
00:48:28,58 --> 00:48:34,93
things. So it actually get information
and then fit the right line information.

505
00:48:35,74 --> 00:48:38,58
So. I guess you're right. This actually

506
00:48:38,58 --> 00:48:45,29
a very very sensitive issue and people are
losing lives and actually other things

507
00:48:46,08 --> 00:48:48,05
but if you find there's actually

508
00:48:48,05 --> 00:48:52,67
a negro meaning or predatory behavior
and so on. It's it's actually very very

509
00:48:52,67 --> 00:48:57,82
serious and what we are finding
actually initial research that

510
00:48:57,82 --> 00:49:04,54
a lot of organizations in the name of
promoting health products for example they

511
00:49:04,55 --> 00:49:08,19
actually preying on the one rebel for
example not knowing what they're doing is

512
00:49:08,19 --> 00:49:15,16
wrong. So yeah. There's some other

513
00:49:15,16 --> 00:49:20,46
research out of america. I can't actually
hold to using the word. You know using

514
00:49:20,46 --> 00:49:26,85
text analysis not sentiment texan else's
any fine people in any domain so if you're

515
00:49:26,85 --> 00:49:30,74
doing any social media and analysis or
anything you find that people within

516
00:49:30,74 --> 00:49:35,92
a domain will actually talk with regards
to tribal language language which actually

517
00:49:35,92 --> 00:49:38,21
involves just

518
00:49:38,22 --> 00:49:43,52
a tribe alone that community and you
need to be aware of this information.

519
00:49:45,19 --> 00:49:50,35
So this is some of the takes use within
the engine to actually get detailed

520
00:49:52,92 --> 00:49:54,49
. I was telling you there. I use

521
00:49:54,49 --> 00:49:59,44
a range of methodology. This is actually
one of the methodology is used for network

522
00:49:59,44 --> 00:50:03,93
mapping try to understand who
talks to whom. And that's

523
00:50:03,93 --> 00:50:10,35
a deal for example here in the middle and
it's probably quite important to this

524
00:50:10,35 --> 00:50:16,73
whole network of people communicating and
then you try to find communicating to

525
00:50:16,73 --> 00:50:23,67
shame. What type of comic issues stand.
And what is actually shared i mean times

526
00:50:23,67 --> 00:50:25,55
actually said something so that

527
00:50:31,50 --> 00:50:34,62
so to use they do use

528
00:50:34,62 --> 00:50:40,83
a measure consider tell we were central
thing. It's just methodology to the idea of

529
00:50:40,83 --> 00:50:46,65
notes who are in between other notes.

530
00:50:47,99 --> 00:50:49,67
I actually teach this in as part of

531
00:50:49,67 --> 00:50:55,55
a unit and flames said for the
class. It's actually 2011. That's

532
00:50:55,55 --> 00:51:01,07
a subject i have two thousand seven some
of the methodology is in there too so we

533
00:51:01,07 --> 00:51:07,78
use this part of this study as well. So
that's actually part of the lottery. So

534
00:51:07,79 --> 00:51:14,46
graph theory helps to identify
networks and to sign to really.

535
00:51:15,71 --> 00:51:19,82
So what takes now assisting you. If there's
any agenda setting grooming territory

536
00:51:19,82 --> 00:51:26,71
financial gains. What intervention can be
done if you could. How can we weaken or

537
00:51:26,71 --> 00:51:29,40
wipe out selected networks. If

538
00:51:29,40 --> 00:51:34,26
a network is actually deemed to be detrimental
to the community correct. So what do

539
00:51:34,26 --> 00:51:41,00
you do. This is some of the
major research questions

540
00:51:41,73 --> 00:51:45,40
and i find that some of them are already
be nonsense of got all these answers

541
00:51:45,40 --> 00:51:49,99
already but the ones right so do they
emulate other online good behaviors. Yes

542
00:51:49,99 --> 00:51:55,29
people are compassionate within them but
they're very reclusive to themselves what

543
00:51:55,29 --> 00:52:01,68
directly messages. Less
than quantity want to whine

544
00:52:03,55 --> 00:52:10,21
call group to do the hysterics. So very
special specific terms on things coming up

545
00:52:11,17 --> 00:52:17,21
there is trouble information and
so this is the most recent i guess

546
00:52:19,04 --> 00:52:23,21
if we get back to your question if this
is private and you know they are actually

547
00:52:23,21 --> 00:52:25,98
harming themselves. What should you do. So

548
00:52:25,98 --> 00:52:31,86
a lot of research institute one strictly
used. Piece not all the time. So the

549
00:52:31,86 --> 00:52:37,85
information based on the tweets. How
can modoc research probably provide

550
00:52:39,74 --> 00:52:46,38
information online information
as e-health prompted.

551
00:52:50,85 --> 00:52:54,09
So roughly when you when you do
analysis this is what you get from

552
00:52:54,09 --> 00:52:59,90
a network making and i actually
taken off of and their feelings

553
00:53:01,93 --> 00:53:08,82
privacy is intact that and
so this using us offical

554
00:53:08,82 --> 00:53:15,73
not accept pretty simple. Many

555
00:53:15,74 --> 00:53:22,57
cluster that you actually get sort of these
different cluster dyslexic talk using

556
00:53:22,57 --> 00:53:26,56
different words and so these are some of
the troubling information we are different

557
00:53:26,56 --> 00:53:31,45
classes and you find of all the classes and
only this was actually sort of healthy

558
00:53:32,26 --> 00:53:37,40
when we dig further analysis and the rest
are probably some of the groups where

559
00:53:37,40 --> 00:53:43,87
they needed help.

560
00:53:44,99 --> 00:53:51,62
Sorry. So what's what you what you're
seeing here is only the high stakes

561
00:53:51,62 --> 00:53:58,06
are the main hashtags and not the text.
So it's actually actual text in else's of

562
00:53:58,07 --> 00:53:59,39
the text you know only me just yet

563
00:54:06,45 --> 00:54:11,45
. It's more about trying to
identify for what reason

564
00:54:25,07 --> 00:54:30,29
. Ok. It's good to understand what domain
you're working in first of for what

565
00:54:30,29 --> 00:54:35,64
reason. So this group of people are very
reclusive. So they wouldn't be exposing

566
00:54:35,64 --> 00:54:38,62
themselves if they are on
a facebook they'll be on

567
00:54:38,62 --> 00:54:44,92
a proud. Site see punish you get any data
out of that at all. So for this reason

568
00:54:44,92 --> 00:54:49,18
for me to actually help your new hampshirites
to understand what's actually going

569
00:54:49,18 --> 00:54:51,75
on twitter seems to be

570
00:54:51,75 --> 00:54:59,70
a good platform. Oh

571
00:54:59,71 --> 00:55:06,36
yeah. Yes i mean and this is actually
based on free free access really mean

572
00:55:06,37 --> 00:55:08,80
a home for melbourne gone to find

573
00:55:08,81 --> 00:55:15,70
a horse model they actually get ninety per
cent of the data. So yes. To answer that

574
00:55:15,70 --> 00:55:20,19
. Yes and i guess it takes different types
of analysis for you to get what you want

575
00:55:21,59 --> 00:55:27,54
and i was asked as yourself. Initially
thinking that. Twitter is just nonsense.

576
00:55:29,04 --> 00:55:32,23
It's just random nonsense actually but
after black saturday that changed my

577
00:55:32,23 --> 00:55:36,40
perspective for what i've got
and how we are allies that so

578
00:55:39,87 --> 00:55:46,30
. No no no no it's not it's we don't use

579
00:55:46,30 --> 00:55:48,93
a border town. It's
actually talking to a p.i.

580
00:55:48,93 --> 00:55:52,08
So getting information from the server
based on certain things that we're looking

581
00:55:52,08 --> 00:55:57,92
for. So twitter. Maybe i would actually
give us information. Yeah yeah. So you can

582
00:55:57,92 --> 00:56:01,82
do crawling you know you're talking about
crawling you know we're not you crawling

583
00:56:01,82 --> 00:56:03,61
at this stage but once you identify

584
00:56:04,32 --> 00:56:09,45
a profile for example and then you can do
crawling on that profile because we just

585
00:56:09,45 --> 00:56:14,06
release crawling then you're looking for
random things we don't need so yeah

586
00:56:18,21 --> 00:56:24,84
. Alright and so this is so i mean if i go
back actually. So this was the data was

587
00:56:24,84 --> 00:56:29,04
actually based on pins brought sort of
things for me and safety pin inspiration and

588
00:56:29,04 --> 00:56:35,72
that's what this poor stands for and here.
So things well you sort of actually

589
00:56:35,72 --> 00:56:40,58
a drive the moment every time you close to
someone you find this train is actually

590
00:56:40,58 --> 00:56:41,76
increasing you know it's

591
00:56:41,76 --> 00:56:47,12
a trending thing doing someone where with
intention to be pain or to become thin

592
00:56:47,12 --> 00:56:53,73
people actually engage in wrong type of
diet and so on but people within anorexia

593
00:56:53,74 --> 00:56:58,54
sort of actually deciding would actually
get even worse. So you take it upon

594
00:56:58,54 --> 00:57:03,99
themselves and here is actually pro
anorexia people talking this hashtag

595
00:57:05,86 --> 00:57:12,23
. This culture of information which is
on their total and retweet and tweet up

596
00:57:12,23 --> 00:57:18,99
information. The double bag on data
that you can actually get from

597
00:57:18,99 --> 00:57:25,79
tipton excel that's more i
guess to some of this you find

598
00:57:25,79 --> 00:57:28,75
just descriptive data but then
when you do a triangulation with

599
00:57:28,75 --> 00:57:33,87
a lot of other information you can actually
get richer information or information

600
00:57:33,87 --> 00:57:37,92
what you want to actually get
more civil than just basics

601
00:57:42,39 --> 00:57:49,18
no meaning to look. There's of the profile

602
00:57:49,18 --> 00:57:53,34
so nominated timezone

603
00:57:58,03 --> 00:58:04,31
nominated times and within australia
i guess not asking his question

604
00:58:05,58 --> 00:58:08,91
can you actually find the people
that you want to find it's

605
00:58:08,92 --> 00:58:13,28
a challenge. You know it's on twitter or
on facebook and whatever it's more about.

606
00:58:15,16 --> 00:58:18,92
If you've got your mobile device i mean
there's two things right one. You actually

607
00:58:18,92 --> 00:58:24,08
expose yourself your actual location and
your date of time and things so that and

608
00:58:24,08 --> 00:58:28,44
decide that this type of information will
be on your profile. And if you don't have

609
00:58:28,44 --> 00:58:35,03
those information then it's based on where
you have accessed an application. So

610
00:58:35,03 --> 00:58:39,36
let's hear got your mobile your connected
to google let's say from soon but not on

611
00:58:41,04 --> 00:58:48,00
google actually had which he originally
logged on from you can get this

612
00:58:48,00 --> 00:58:53,55
information so and you can use this
information to find out where people are

613
00:58:53,55 --> 00:59:00,51
accessing from and where
they're going to. So you know

614
00:59:00,51 --> 00:59:00,73
in

615
00:59:00,73 --> 00:59:05,72
a lot of cases for murder research it was
actually what i was interested in or are

616
00:59:05,72 --> 00:59:10,08
you tracking globally. Where where the
australians. Where are those trillions

617
00:59:10,08 --> 00:59:16,16
really and what are they doing. So my
answer to them as actually we need fewer

618
00:59:16,16 --> 00:59:20,54
layers few methodology is to put together
to find out about stranger. One is

619
00:59:20,54 --> 00:59:25,90
actually trying to find out if people use.
Words that i only use in australia for

620
00:59:25,90 --> 00:59:31,08
example not anywhere else. So you do
different sort of analysis and then you get

621
00:59:31,08 --> 00:59:33,69
back and find your network

622
00:59:38,41 --> 00:59:45,36
. So this is an example of network
mapping. And this was actually

623
00:59:45,36 --> 00:59:49,92
presented yesterday to the butterfly
foundation which is actually the national

624
00:59:49,92 --> 00:59:56,86
foundation for eating disorders
and ari's remove all the

625
00:59:56,86 --> 01:00:03,63
names for the class people you
know what do you find it's

626
01:00:03,63 --> 01:00:09,69
you can break and understand how
people are going to different times of

627
01:00:10,74 --> 01:00:17,63
anorexic behaviour. And what do they.
Do we need in that domain. So yes

628
01:00:17,63 --> 01:00:18,83
like someone is from wanting

629
01:00:20,18 --> 01:00:26,29
a very through extreme exercise
or there is discussion.

630
01:00:27,11 --> 01:00:33,54
And yeah. While i'm trying to
become a buddy to help and sharing

631
01:00:33,54 --> 01:00:39,19
a living for tips on how to be less. Some
of them actually quite concerning because

632
01:00:39,88 --> 01:00:44,63
they all say for lunch is actually just
like a pumpkin for example. That's

633
01:00:44,64 --> 01:00:51,64
a lunch and drink. And two litres
of water for breakfast you

634
01:00:51,65 --> 01:00:56,85
find that it's actually going against all
they've got an issue with regards to

635
01:00:56,85 --> 01:01:02,90
understanding what food is and eating.
So what we are trying to find out is

636
01:01:02,90 --> 01:01:07,57
actually this kind of
behavior this hanging from

637
01:01:07,57 --> 01:01:11,57
a show like this would this may work
actually grow. How fast we grow what kind of

638
01:01:11,57 --> 01:01:15,91
patient actually takes other people. Is
it you may choose to text is racially

639
01:01:15,91 --> 01:01:20,35
videos. What do they share and what
they should probably. So you find you'd

640
01:01:20,35 --> 01:01:24,76
actually follow and see if the network is
growing or the group is actually growing

641
01:01:24,76 --> 01:01:30,70
and wanting this summer called
book approach using tax analysis.

642
01:01:33,21 --> 01:01:38,51
Different types of these again i connected
to the graph earlier show to actually

643
01:01:38,51 --> 01:01:45,22
find clusters and data. I guess going
to the adult experience actually quite

644
01:01:45,22 --> 01:01:50,89
complex. Unless you follow into it.

645
01:01:52,36 --> 01:01:58,94
And this is actually over time so you can
see this are users and you know let's all

646
01:01:58,94 --> 01:02:03,85
the time with regards to communicating and
using you know if you do all the time

647
01:02:03,85 --> 01:02:08,06
lapse analysis trends and
worth a comic it's a letter

648
01:02:08,06 --> 01:02:14,29
a bug sample of this user x to have actually
sent 200 tweets to whom they sent and

649
01:02:14,29 --> 01:02:19,73
on and what what's actually sent that's
the other thing that could actually also

650
01:02:19,73 --> 01:02:26,69
attract some

651
01:02:26,70 --> 01:02:33,42
profiles that were actually
seen. Ok. Way to from here.

652
01:02:33,69 --> 01:02:35,29
So i guess for me being

653
01:02:35,29 --> 01:02:42,17
a researcher and also working with
industrious and within this domain. We are

654
01:02:42,17 --> 01:02:49,05
talking to twitter. In february. Yes

655
01:02:50,53 --> 01:02:56,59
you get you all trying to appear

656
01:03:01,39 --> 01:03:08,26
. With it. It's actually very tricky.
You're correct. It's very tricky when

657
01:03:08,26 --> 01:03:14,70
we when i presented terms here ryan re
spoke to the team there because they treat

658
01:03:14,70 --> 01:03:20,18
people with this disorder it's and for
them was all while we did know so much is

659
01:03:20,18 --> 01:03:26,70
happening online and this is no. So this
other people on the ground actually

660
01:03:26,70 --> 01:03:33,05
helping to solve this problems and they've
got less information about this things.

661
01:03:34,53 --> 01:03:40,30
So for them was what can we do or how can
we help and and and you know trying to

662
01:03:40,30 --> 01:03:47,25
bridge where social media is and the
actual practices. So over there the moment

663
01:03:47,25 --> 01:03:51,85
someone or patients come in they confiscate
all their forms and they're totally

664
01:03:51,85 --> 01:03:58,30
non-digital and they're meant to do
what they don't like most to eat.

665
01:03:58,31 --> 01:04:00,83
So the treatment often fails. So it's not

666
01:04:00,83 --> 01:04:06,19
a positive experience for the patients.
So they don't actually take that. So what

667
01:04:06,19 --> 01:04:10,97
we're trying to do is actually trying to
bridge that gap if we can actually do some

668
01:04:10,97 --> 01:04:17,61
sort of staged intervention. So the

669
01:04:17,62 --> 01:04:19,44
scientist for you take should get into

670
01:04:19,44 --> 01:04:24,11
a network you need to be trusted. You need
to be someone part of the network. So

671
01:04:24,12 --> 01:04:28,93
you either have to rope someone within the
networks that i showed you before and

672
01:04:28,94 --> 01:04:33,97
know who's actually within that circle or
you yourself or get someone to be within

673
01:04:33,97 --> 01:04:39,06
that circle. Once you're in that circle
then you can actually start working in

674
01:04:39,07 --> 01:04:44,80
a different way to sending
positive messages. And

675
01:04:55,61 --> 01:04:59,65
it's got yeah. I mean there's

676
01:04:59,65 --> 01:05:02,42
a lot of strategies right if you talk to
the police. They'll actually say let's put

677
01:05:02,42 --> 01:05:02,73
a gag order

678
01:05:04,50 --> 01:05:11,12
a gag order is literally trying to strike
your account to be inconsistent. So it'll

679
01:05:11,12 --> 01:05:16,97
work for three days. The next one week
it's not going to work overtime just

680
01:05:16,97 --> 01:05:20,69
overtime period of certain basics not
going to work because you've got

681
01:05:20,69 --> 01:05:24,65
a gag order on your tweet. I try to
reduce or make you sort of actually

682
01:05:24,65 --> 01:05:28,31
a person who's inconsistent in the
group. So if you are inconsistent

683
01:05:28,31 --> 01:05:34,66
a group people drop out following you.
Right. So you suddenly being your your role

684
01:05:34,66 --> 01:05:40,63
in the network becomes less and lesser so
it's not significant. So you could you

685
01:05:40,63 --> 01:05:46,34
could devise these things but in an
intervention is more thoughts. Tried oh i

686
01:05:46,34 --> 01:05:52,19
understand then still compassionately sort
of help them out because you find this

687
01:05:52,19 --> 01:05:56,65
people are not only physically ill.
But also mentally sort of disturbed

688
01:05:56,65 --> 01:06:02,71
a sense having a wrong image on body
image so it's a challenge. It's

689
01:06:02,71 --> 01:06:08,44
a challenge but yeah. I
guess everybody helps.

690
01:06:10,52 --> 01:06:16,29
So this is sort of the thing in february
and probably know what what we are going

691
01:06:16,29 --> 01:06:23,15
to do after meeting twitter. So that's.

692
01:06:25,82 --> 01:06:30,07
So guys any questions on.
On anything. Actually

693
01:06:33,45 --> 01:06:40,15
i mean magic. Have you heard much about
that now basically with stuff in terms of

694
01:06:40,15 --> 01:06:47,15
how much of you followed the social
media stuff with donald trump you know

695
01:06:48,61 --> 01:06:55,27
in terms of not him but all
the people but the people.

696
01:06:56,52 --> 01:07:03,34
Fans your avi. Yeah. Have you
followed the politics of

697
01:07:03,34 --> 01:07:09,51
yeah yeah. The movies that that were created
or around the discussion or back to

698
01:07:09,51 --> 01:07:15,99
the stuff that basically stuff that
brought regular john already people

699
01:07:15,99 --> 01:07:21,51
to politics for room. I mean basically

700
01:07:23,59 --> 01:07:28,32
i've sort of actually read few of those
articles but i'm not sure which one you're

701
01:07:28,32 --> 01:07:34,94
pointing to. So i guess you're supporting
safety racing because clinton was sort of

702
01:07:34,94 --> 01:07:41,94
actually was. I guess was almost
assumed to win but that was because

703
01:07:41,94 --> 01:07:48,76
of biased reporting and how everyone to
social media is interesting. Right. We

704
01:07:48,76 --> 01:07:54,91
get into feeds and information we are very
selective of what we want to know and we

705
01:07:54,91 --> 01:07:55,87
just listen to just

706
01:07:55,87 --> 01:08:01,77
a few when the general population might
be trending toward something else and it

707
01:08:01,77 --> 01:08:07,95
might be not in our favor. And so the more
we hear news which is not in our favor.

708
01:08:07,98 --> 01:08:12,90
We actually oppose and actually for turnout
and that was sort of happening in the

709
01:08:12,90 --> 01:08:19,60
us where crucial states for example
were driven by means which were helping

710
01:08:19,60 --> 01:08:26,58
to words for example detroit the industrial
revolution bringing back manufacturing

711
01:08:26,58 --> 01:08:32,23
. I mean to us. I'm going
for the second amendment

712
01:08:34,29 --> 01:08:40,02
having gun laws approved and actually
flourishing i guess approving 3d printing for

713
01:08:40,02 --> 01:08:43,06
guns in the us. I think
so. That was actually

714
01:08:43,06 --> 01:08:47,51
a big thing. Against and those
following clinton was actually

715
01:08:47,51 --> 01:08:50,84
a very staunch clinton was not listening
to what has also been on the other side.

716
01:08:51,55 --> 01:08:54,54
So it. Yeah it's

717
01:08:54,54 --> 01:08:59,08
a tough thing to be through you know.
So this is something where president.

718
01:08:59,10 --> 01:09:06,06
Decision. Jim clancy is awful but this
is very good news to interview people

719
01:09:06,06 --> 01:09:10,48
who source good information you give what
you know that you know my sister and

720
01:09:10,48 --> 01:09:16,98
prejudices correct. And this is resulted
in this really tense but i think you put

721
01:09:16,98 --> 01:09:23,60
it in the united states you
know it's not so much about

722
01:09:23,60 --> 01:09:30,08
policy interviews code sections
of government and government

723
01:09:30,08 --> 01:09:36,71
to social welfare state and national

724
01:09:36,71 --> 01:09:43,54
recession. So if you get it right you can
try this with some federal credit even if

725
01:09:43,54 --> 01:09:50,48
that base is refusal to researching she
made some twitter speak. She was willing to

726
01:09:51,26 --> 01:09:57,88
do you know what that means for american
politics and we still have to fight

727
01:09:57,88 --> 01:10:04,63
confucius said that saying to me the
interesting times. And i think you know

728
01:10:04,63 --> 01:10:11,29
that it's happening everywhere so
you can see on that point you said

729
01:10:12,39 --> 01:10:17,73
you know that i don't know about
polls and i consider that

730
01:10:17,73 --> 01:10:24,43
a complete failure. One by the
way. How do you people like that

731
01:10:24,43 --> 01:10:30,61
so wrong. I guess if you will.

732
01:10:31,67 --> 01:10:34,39
I don't know it's more about i
guess more for a politician

733
01:10:34,39 --> 01:10:39,13
a clinton state you've got consultants.
You've got strategies weekly runs around

734
01:10:39,13 --> 01:10:43,09
interracially and you got campaign
managers at different states organizing

735
01:10:43,09 --> 01:10:48,58
campaigns and you have
fed my information. But

736
01:10:50,26 --> 01:10:54,96
you know clinton clinton was i guess to
have an ideal and then she had all these

737
01:10:54,96 --> 01:11:01,50
other things going on and it
was the cia the e-mails the

738
01:11:01,50 --> 01:11:06,83
wrong e-mail sent leaking and you know being
that being investigated right point to

739
01:11:06,83 --> 01:11:11,33
time just after the second debate
that befell you live. We think yes

740
01:11:16,60 --> 01:11:22,25
and all that and now russia is trying to
rush elicit no medaling yes god. Yes.

741
01:11:24,24 --> 01:11:30,67
Yes. Right or

742
01:11:31,58 --> 01:11:35,97
right or

743
01:11:44,74 --> 01:11:50,02
i or any

744
01:11:51,63 --> 01:11:57,27
good question code it's hard to say
what he said thickly and what is not

745
01:11:58,41 --> 01:12:04,37
and and yes. Australian self has got to
at because standard. Yes but it's always

746
01:12:05,60 --> 01:12:09,47
play playing catch up kind of thing with
what's happening with the technology by

747
01:12:09,47 --> 01:12:15,35
the new and we find that before it
becomes a policy and adopted as

748
01:12:15,35 --> 01:12:20,48
a law. It takes a long time. It's
organized themselves have all got

749
01:12:20,48 --> 01:12:23,26
a city policy which actually adheres to

750
01:12:23,26 --> 01:12:30,18
a fix. But they're not the best.
So i guess. If the other view

751
01:12:30,18 --> 01:12:36,45
is more about making money
in profit and data rules.

752
01:12:36,80 --> 01:12:43,20
So you can sell data. So the more you collect
the more you can capture from all the

753
01:12:43,20 --> 01:12:49,21
touch points. The more ammunition you
have to actually sell or outsource data

754
01:12:50,75 --> 01:12:51,21
and you are in

755
01:12:51,21 --> 01:12:57,26
a position where someone can mine your
data and get you more information in the

756
01:12:57,26 --> 01:13:02,60
process of understanding accustomed better
or trending better and everyone is in

757
01:13:02,60 --> 01:13:08,15
this race. Everyone when you don't have
if you're not in their race. You've got

758
01:13:08,15 --> 01:13:13,95
someone out to do it and you've got people
doing it for free. These days. You've

759
01:13:13,95 --> 01:13:17,22
got a hobbyist mining data and
then they will sell you for

760
01:13:17,22 --> 01:13:24,14
a price really great. I guess

761
01:13:24,14 --> 01:13:28,49
it's more about when you see the plate
or how is it applied because it's

762
01:13:28,49 --> 01:13:35,41
a law so public data really or this
one. For example got two things one

763
01:13:35,41 --> 01:13:39,39
relating to that point you know about few
years ago you know in the actual doable.

764
01:13:40,66 --> 01:13:43,48
How we should run this company sort
of document that all this here is

765
01:13:43,48 --> 01:13:49,30
a good idea by the first point was that
we will not be able. I think if that

766
01:13:51,83 --> 01:13:57,40
is where things go on the second one for
the actual parking garage and of your sort

767
01:13:57,40 --> 01:14:03,02
of groups. You know you had all of you
know what would you say that you kind of

768
01:14:03,02 --> 01:14:03,51
come up with

769
01:14:03,51 --> 01:14:08,88
a book or had that sort of out there
with you. Forest or no roma. It was more

770
01:14:08,88 --> 01:14:14,89
generated. Yeah i guess it's generated by
by the competition itself. Yeah but this

771
01:14:14,89 --> 01:14:19,90
is competition. We don't you cry. You know.
So what do you finance. Just because

772
01:14:19,90 --> 01:14:25,72
you asked. A person friends could be ten
but them pro and i could be five of them

773
01:14:25,72 --> 01:14:29,92
and the five of them are normal friends.
So if you go back to their twitter. They

774
01:14:29,92 --> 01:14:30,13
do

775
01:14:30,13 --> 01:14:36,67
a network map on the actual twitter you find
that you get more of the netbook and then

776
01:14:36,67 --> 01:14:38,98
you find which you know you know it's

777
01:14:38,98 --> 01:14:44,34
a great example and then you try to carve
out was good news bad and because of that

778
01:14:44,34 --> 01:14:49,12
but yeah so this was based
on sitting by the data

779
01:14:58,25 --> 01:15:01,53
. That you

780
01:15:10,00 --> 01:15:12,04
know it is it was

781
01:15:12,04 --> 01:15:17,49
a challenge the first five months or four
months because we didn't cover the whole

782
01:15:17,49 --> 01:15:22,30
plethora of words but after that you
find the seeding in the more of

783
01:15:22,30 --> 01:15:28,43
a hashtag is actually organically
saturating because there's no new words.

784
01:15:29,37 --> 01:15:33,57
Except for him appearing related to

785
01:15:33,57 --> 01:15:40,00
a free vent for example. And you
can sort of guess all that were.

786
01:15:40,38 --> 01:15:46,69
Alternated from this and because the data
is more than sixteen months for example

787
01:15:46,69 --> 01:15:51,32
of data. It sort of balancing itself in

788
01:15:51,33 --> 01:15:56,74
a way for english at least they're spanish
all those language i would languages

789
01:15:56,74 --> 01:16:02,49
which is yeah i would domain so. But
yeah. What i'm trying to find out now is

790
01:16:02,49 --> 01:16:08,73
a shell of the many thousand lines is
actually trying to find trouble words. So i

791
01:16:08,73 --> 01:16:13,77
will break key what australians use and
you find northern territory queensland

792
01:16:13,77 --> 01:16:14,25
might actually have

793
01:16:14,25 --> 01:16:19,78
a different look every compared to tory
and sydney siders some australians are

794
01:16:19,78 --> 01:16:26,31
different and. That's australia different.
So you find if you drill for the day you

795
01:16:26,31 --> 01:16:32,55
get to tribal language and you find different
events connected to that member would

796
01:16:32,55 --> 01:16:36,11
be connected to melbourne more compared
to something else happening not in

797
01:16:36,11 --> 01:16:40,75
territory. You get to down to that
stage cereno that has checked level

798
01:16:40,75 --> 01:16:44,04
a state level it's sort
of saturating and so it's

799
01:16:49,20 --> 01:16:53,26
good questions. It was very interesting
thing troops and you know i think you

800
01:16:53,26 --> 01:16:55,12
should thank you guys you know

801
01:17:00,35 --> 01:17:06,60
just about an extreme be your guest presenter
here is very much like are you scared

802
01:17:06,60 --> 01:17:13,53
of information security at telstra and
an extremely tough to do some things i

803
01:17:13,53 --> 01:17:19,65
present to the point that well with people
who thinks expertise stop the right of

804
01:17:19,65 --> 01:17:26,48
government to of australian
society. And you were talking

805
01:17:26,48 --> 01:17:27,01
about

806
01:17:27,01 --> 01:17:33,57
a personalization of the i think i think
from that which is not the organization

807
01:17:33,57 --> 01:17:39,67
that you know these remote areas uniquely

808
01:17:43,34 --> 01:17:47,22
like to go through.

809
01:17:54,08 --> 01:17:57,20
I just think if you.
