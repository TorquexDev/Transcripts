1
00:00:01,60 --> 00:00:07,47
Well first of all thank you everyone for
coming tonight it is quite humbling to see

2
00:00:07,84 --> 00:00:14,74
so many people here I suppose suppose
for me the most proud part of seeing

3
00:00:14,75 --> 00:00:19,72
everyone here other people tonight is the
diversity of the crowd. We've got people

4
00:00:19,73 --> 00:00:25,36
here from that have been in business for
decades. People that there are still

5
00:00:25,37 --> 00:00:31,44
international students graduates and then
accountants lawyers start up people it is

6
00:00:31,70 --> 00:00:35,78
really what we're about and what we're
trying to build the diversity the

7
00:00:35,79 --> 00:00:41,77
integration. If we think about international
students international graduates where

8
00:00:41,78 --> 00:00:47,10
they've come from They've left their
networks at home they've left their families

9
00:00:47,36 --> 00:00:53,02
their friends their uni friends their school
friends and comes another country and

10
00:00:53,36 --> 00:00:55,24
I think we've had over
grammar myself being

11
00:00:55,25 --> 00:00:58,30
a Melburnian my whole life I actually know
lots of people in Melbourne I know how

12
00:00:58,31 --> 00:01:01,50
to get connected the people the international
students in grades don't have though

13
00:01:01,87 --> 00:01:03,11
so to bring everyone into

14
00:01:03,12 --> 00:01:07,19
a room like this to be able to connect with
each other is something that we're very

15
00:01:07,20 --> 00:01:10,37
proud of and something we're really trying
to achieve we see our role as being

16
00:01:10,38 --> 00:01:14,20
a facilitate that and it's something we're
going to continue to push along for in

17
00:01:14,21 --> 00:01:20,68
the future. Just with the how
