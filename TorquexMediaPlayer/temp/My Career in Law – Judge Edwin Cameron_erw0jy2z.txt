1
00:00:04,54 --> 00:00:10,27
Watching ladies and gentlemen can you hear
me in the army at the back how are you

2
00:00:10,28 --> 00:00:16,61
this morning. That's to
do that how you. Are you

3
00:00:16,62 --> 00:00:22,16
enthusiastic. And I tell you I want you to
be believe me first say good morning to

4
00:00:22,17 --> 00:00:28,62
you moron. The much lower me.
Where are the vendors speakers.

5
00:00:29,81 --> 00:00:30,46
That's give them

6
00:00:30,47 --> 00:00:37,23
a hand. And where are the
Tonga speakers who are the

7
00:00:37,24 --> 00:00:39,50
Tonga speakers Yes let's give them

8
00:00:39,51 --> 00:00:46,42
a hand as well. They are too small the
smallest linguistic groups and I'll come

9
00:00:46,43 --> 00:00:47,18
back to that point in

10
00:00:47,19 --> 00:00:52,83
a moment because of the importance of
understanding that So ladies and gentleman I

11
00:00:52,84 --> 00:00:53,47
want to say just

12
00:00:53,48 --> 00:00:58,64
a few things to you the first thing I want
to say is that it's really interesting

13
00:00:59,25 --> 00:01:02,61
to be a lawyer in South Africa and
particularly interesting to be

14
00:01:02,97 --> 00:01:07,24
a lawyer in South Africa now say I want
you to be interested I want you to be

15
00:01:07,25 --> 00:01:13,89
enthusiastic The second thing I want
to say to you is that the law repays

16
00:01:13,90 --> 00:01:19,42
hard work can you get me right back there.
Are you are you OK there you are with

17
00:01:19,43 --> 00:01:26,36
a change to Tonga. That's good

18
00:01:26,37 --> 00:01:27,12
you as always call

19
00:01:27,13 --> 00:01:32,92
a lawyer's bluff very good ladies and
gentlemen the second thing is that the law

20
00:01:33,27 --> 00:01:39,94
repays hard work. One of my mentors used
to say to me you're not entitled to

21
00:01:39,95 --> 00:01:46,02
express an opinion on the issue until
you know what the cases say. So there's

22
00:01:46,03 --> 00:01:48,75
a lot of hard work with law
you're going to have to read

23
00:01:48,76 --> 00:01:53,99
a lot of cases lot of our cases people tell
me are judgments are too long I agree.

24
00:01:56,00 --> 00:02:01,40
But it repays hard work so read the cases
read the materials that your tutors and

25
00:02:01,41 --> 00:02:06,37
your lecturers give you because when you
read them you are better informed and when

26
00:02:06,38 --> 00:02:08,34
you're better informed you become

27
00:02:08,35 --> 00:02:14,32
a better lawyer Some people say well you
know that issue about the Scorpions of the

28
00:02:14,33 --> 00:02:19,27
hawks anyone can decided it's not true
the law is an intricate mechanism

29
00:02:20,68 --> 00:02:26,65
a legal system goes back several thousand
years to Roman Roman Dutch law the

30
00:02:26,66 --> 00:02:29,49
transitional law and our
Constitution there's

31
00:02:29,50 --> 00:02:36,10
a lot at stake and the third thing I want
to tell you. Is that very point that we

32
00:02:36,11 --> 00:02:37,62
have a fight on our hands

33
00:02:38,57 --> 00:02:45,33
a fight on our hands that we cannot take
for granted. We've had a legal system

34
00:02:45,34 --> 00:02:46,24
a constitution

35
00:02:46,25 --> 00:02:53,13
a constitutional democracy for twenty one
years and it's worth fighting for. And my

36
00:02:53,14 --> 00:02:56,52
third message to you is that
you as young lawyers have

37
00:02:56,53 --> 00:03:02,16
a particular responsibility. At this time
in our democracy to fight for democracy

38
00:03:02,74 --> 00:03:07,86
to fight for independent institutions to
fight for the rule of law and to fight for

39
00:03:07,87 --> 00:03:12,49
social justice because without
social justice we won't have

40
00:03:12,50 --> 00:03:18,80
a legal system that's my whole message that
is in gentlemen now you can go to lunch

41
00:03:18,80 --> 00:03:25,51
. So I repeat it all OK I want to repeat
it all because it's important ladies and

42
00:03:25,52 --> 00:03:29,89
gentlemen let me start with
why it's so interesting to be

43
00:03:29,90 --> 00:03:36,12
a lawyer in South Africa and the reason
is that the centrepiece of our democracy

44
00:03:36,74 --> 00:03:42,36
is the Constitution and the rule of law.
And to understand why that is we have to

45
00:03:42,37 --> 00:03:47,45
go back to our history. And
to go back to apartheid.

46
00:03:49,74 --> 00:03:54,62
And what was unique about apartheid is that
it was enforced through the law it was

47
00:03:54,63 --> 00:04:01,12
a man mutely legally regulated system where
people like me and Zeiss from sale said

48
00:04:01,13 --> 00:04:05,35
to people like you that you cannot be equal
under the law because of the colour of

49
00:04:05,36 --> 00:04:07,12
your skin it was

50
00:04:07,13 --> 00:04:13,31
a shameful thing ladies and gentlemen. And
its main feature was that it used the

51
00:04:13,32 --> 00:04:20,27
law legal statutes legal regulations
proclamations it was my new key details

52
00:04:21,36 --> 00:04:27,29
but the paradox was that if you try
to enforce any system through the law

53
00:04:28,55 --> 00:04:34,58
the law must have authority the law isn't
brute force brute force is simply the

54
00:04:34,59 --> 00:04:39,91
police and the dictator's thugs enforcing
the world with truncheons and with

55
00:04:40,17 --> 00:04:41,63
machine guns if you've got

56
00:04:41,64 --> 00:04:47,16
a system of law and you want the lortab
authority there's got to be some justice.

57
00:04:48,60 --> 00:04:51,77
And that some justice is what

58
00:04:51,78 --> 00:04:58,25
a whole generation of public interest
lawyers fought for under apartheid starting

59
00:04:58,26 --> 00:04:59,73
with mr. Nelson Mandela who was

60
00:04:59,74 --> 00:05:05,52
a young attorney in his 30s when the fines
campaign started in one hundred fifty

61
00:05:06,24 --> 00:05:10,69
and he used the legal system he believed
in the legal system it was unjust and

62
00:05:10,70 --> 00:05:16,95
oppressive it was racist but he knew that
the law should be for something else

63
00:05:17,70 --> 00:05:21,77
the law should not be to take away people's
dignity to tell them that they are

64
00:05:21,78 --> 00:05:28,47
inferior the law should be to say you as
an individual your beauty and your dignity

65
00:05:28,48 --> 00:05:34,11
can flourish. Under the legal system and
the quality under dignity under values

66
00:05:34,12 --> 00:05:40,80
under aspirations and with social rights
he knew that and he saw that. And so we

67
00:05:40,81 --> 00:05:44,07
had a very big fight under apartheid

68
00:05:44,11 --> 00:05:49,74
a fight for justice which mostly
lost but which one often enough.

69
00:05:52,07 --> 00:05:57,37
So that if the end of apartheid people
knew that we could use the legal system

70
00:05:58,19 --> 00:06:03,76
unjust as it was we could use that legal
system as the basis for creating our

71
00:06:03,77 --> 00:06:08,94
future and we are work now in Constitution
Hill how many of you have been to

72
00:06:08,95 --> 00:06:13,45
Constitution Hill. Put up your hands that's
that's very last but I want you all to

73
00:06:13,46 --> 00:06:18,26
come you must all make a point of coming
to Constitution Hill it's well worth

74
00:06:18,27 --> 00:06:25,21
a visit in our courtroom we've taken
the bricks from the prison where black

75
00:06:25,22 --> 00:06:29,71
people mostly black men were imprisoned
yet have a POS if you didn't have

76
00:06:29,72 --> 00:06:32,60
a POS you got arrested and put into

77
00:06:32,61 --> 00:06:37,34
a police van and you were taken to number
four right there in Branford and on

78
00:06:37,35 --> 00:06:43,37
Constitution Hill next to the fort and the
women's jail and hundreds of thousands

79
00:06:43,38 --> 00:06:49,81
probably millions of mostly black men who
were POS offenders possed through that

80
00:06:49,81 --> 00:06:55,59
prison and the bricks from that prison
of the foundations and the walls of our

81
00:06:55,61 --> 00:06:58,31
court. In the Constitution so

82
00:06:58,36 --> 00:07:02,84
a constitution is rooted
in the past its not

83
00:07:02,85 --> 00:07:09,54
a constitution that says we are all equal.
Because our past has made us unequal

84
00:07:09,98 --> 00:07:14,35
on grounds of gender on grounds of race on
grounds of culture on grounds of sexual

85
00:07:14,36 --> 00:07:21,19
orientation. Sexual orientation.
I mentioned the word.

86
00:07:22,53 --> 00:07:28,25
Can I have a beef digression ladies
and gentlemen I'm a gay man. And I'm

87
00:07:28,26 --> 00:07:35,07
a proudly gay man. Why am I proud to be
gay for the same reason that I'm proud to

88
00:07:35,08 --> 00:07:41,60
be white. Why I'm a proud to be white
because it's the way I am I don't have

89
00:07:41,61 --> 00:07:45,13
a choice about it is the way I was born
that's beautiful to be white it's not

90
00:07:45,14 --> 00:07:51,85
better than black the way I am it's the
same with being gay or lesbian. If you

91
00:07:51,86 --> 00:07:52,95
straights if you hate

92
00:07:52,96 --> 00:07:56,80
a sexual opposite sex or into this the way
you are you were born that way there's

93
00:07:56,81 --> 00:08:00,24
nothing you can do about it some
of your mixed up bisexual across

94
00:08:00,25 --> 00:08:06,60
a spectrum of sexuality. But sexual
orientation and gender diversity and gender

95
00:08:06,61 --> 00:08:11,40
sensitivity are important on the you
Jake campus they're important in the law

96
00:08:11,41 --> 00:08:17,01
school and I make that diversionary
point right away I mentioned that I am

97
00:08:17,02 --> 00:08:22,28
a gay man because all of you every single
one of you where the vendor speakers put

98
00:08:22,29 --> 00:08:26,91
up your hands again you've all got lesbian
and gay relatives ladies and gentlemen

99
00:08:26,92 --> 00:08:32,79
most of you just don't know it. If you've
got ten how many of you have got ten or

100
00:08:32,80 --> 00:08:36,21
more relatives put up your hands if you
will tell them or cousins brothers and

101
00:08:36,22 --> 00:08:41,99
sisters all of you you've all got gay
lesbian relatives. Because one in ten of

102
00:08:42,00 --> 00:08:48,57
humanity. Is either same sex are entered
one in twenty is exclusively same sex or

103
00:08:48,58 --> 00:08:55,33
entered like me and another one in twenty
is along that spectrum of bisexuality

104
00:08:55,79 --> 00:09:01,90
of same sex interests leaning heterosexual
leaning homosexual so ten per cent of

105
00:09:01,94 --> 00:09:07,40
humanity is gender diverse ladies and
gentlemen get used to it it's as Archbishop

106
00:09:07,41 --> 00:09:12,35
Tutu says we've got famines we've got
wars we've got corruption we've got

107
00:09:12,36 --> 00:09:17,03
misgovernance We've got terrorism we've
got religious extremism on the African

108
00:09:17,04 --> 00:09:20,64
continent we don't need to worry about
sexual orientation Do you agree ladies and

109
00:09:20,65 --> 00:09:27,52
gentlemen anyone who doesn't agree. We
welcome to cover related gentlemen it's an

110
00:09:27,53 --> 00:09:32,91
important issue of my gender diversity as
well about femininity do you feel safe on

111
00:09:32,92 --> 00:09:38,59
this campus ma'am you must feel safe and
you must feel respected by every single

112
00:09:38,60 --> 00:09:42,07
man because your gender is
important and your gender as

113
00:09:42,08 --> 00:09:48,30
a woman is important and precious to us so
we must cultivate that sense of respect

114
00:09:48,31 --> 00:09:55,26
inside the law school. So
ladies and gentlemen. We fought

115
00:09:56,13 --> 00:09:56,27
for

116
00:09:56,28 --> 00:10:01,85
a constitution that came into effect twenty
one years ago. A constitution that's built

117
00:10:02,54 --> 00:10:09,19
on respect for diversity diversity
which apartheid rejected and had

118
00:10:09,20 --> 00:10:15,02
contempt for apartheid prised whiteness
and maleness and heterosexuality.

119
00:10:16,18 --> 00:10:20,77
And in the Constitution we said we turning
our backs on that and it was the right

120
00:10:20,78 --> 00:10:24,09
thing to do because as we were becoming

121
00:10:24,10 --> 00:10:30,83
a democracy in April 1994.
We saw evidence of what

122
00:10:30,84 --> 00:10:37,53
happens when you don't value an embrace
and celebrate diversity. And we

123
00:10:37,54 --> 00:10:42,49
saw that evidence at the very same time
as we were having our national elections

124
00:10:42,50 --> 00:10:48,66
and April 9th 104 we sorted through
anger in Rwandan three months

125
00:10:49,69 --> 00:10:54,78
900000 seas were massacred Is there
anyone here from ruined or Burundi.

126
00:10:58,59 --> 00:10:59,82
10000 People

127
00:10:59,83 --> 00:11:06,33
a day every day for ninety
days ladies and gentlemen. So

128
00:11:06,68 --> 00:11:07,81
our continent has

129
00:11:07,82 --> 00:11:14,67
a terrible history of disrespecting diversity
and the reason why our singled out

130
00:11:14,68 --> 00:11:19,53
the vendor speakers in the Tonga speakers
is that our Constitution recognizes their

131
00:11:19,54 --> 00:11:23,57
languages even though they are
both groups of only about

132
00:11:23,58 --> 00:11:28,62
a million people. Of conspicuous first
language speakers what six or seven million

133
00:11:29,02 --> 00:11:34,90
Zulu speakers. seventy Million sorry
seven million to others it is because.

134
00:11:36,39 --> 00:11:40,94
You admit that you promote
your language rightly so it's

135
00:11:40,95 --> 00:11:45,73
a beautiful language but they all equal
the language of commerce the language of

136
00:11:46,25 --> 00:11:50,95
communication in the courts the language
of business in our court as well as mainly

137
00:11:50,96 --> 00:11:57,00
English but we do have litigants who come
to us and offer consul closer you're

138
00:11:57,01 --> 00:12:02,54
entitled to do so because the very premise
of the Constitution is not just that we

139
00:12:02,68 --> 00:12:07,57
tolerate diversity and difference but that
we actually draw our strength from it

140
00:12:08,88 --> 00:12:15,39
and that you as young lawyers or sent
into the world to rgp to respect and to

141
00:12:15,40 --> 00:12:21,63
promote and to fulfil. So that isn't
gentlemen the other principles of the

142
00:12:21,64 --> 00:12:27,08
Constitution which are primary those
which are called to say to God of the

143
00:12:27,09 --> 00:12:29,31
separation of powers mr.

144
00:12:29,32 --> 00:12:34,85
Van sale we talked this morning Eunice
colleagues are an independent institution

145
00:12:34,86 --> 00:12:39,97
guaranteed by the Constitution the
National Prosecuting Authority has

146
00:12:39,98 --> 00:12:46,16
constitutional independence to decide who
should be prosecuted and it's unlawful to

147
00:12:46,17 --> 00:12:50,99
interfere with their decisions. We having

148
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:56,07
a crisis of independence right now ladies
and gentlemen. And that comes back to my

149
00:12:56,08 --> 00:13:01,76
third point which is the fact that you're
all involved in we've got to fight on our

150
00:13:01,77 --> 00:13:08,63
hands. We cannot simply assume
that legal values social justice.

151
00:13:11,14 --> 00:13:17,42
Aspirations towards equality and dignity
we cannot assume that the rule of law is

152
00:13:17,43 --> 00:13:22,65
going to triumph because the powerful
forces that are opposed to the OR powerful

153
00:13:22,66 --> 00:13:29,26
forces. They don't like independent
institutions it's not unique to South Africa

154
00:13:29,27 --> 00:13:34,06
let into and I mean I'm not making a political
statement about President Zuma or mr.

155
00:13:34,10 --> 00:13:41,06
Mullin MA or anyone else. In
any democracy where you have

156
00:13:41,07 --> 00:13:45,03
power you have to have separation of
powers you have to have a judiciary

157
00:13:45,61 --> 00:13:52,31
a legislature and an executive and you
have to have them balancing each other and

158
00:13:52,32 --> 00:13:57,76
the most important component of the
separation of powers is the judiciary and

159
00:13:57,77 --> 00:14:03,88
without strong minded capable hard working
lawyers the judiciary cannot work

160
00:14:04,84 --> 00:14:07,26
so the task upon your
shoulders is very big.

161
00:14:15,63 --> 00:14:16,21
We've still got

162
00:14:16,22 --> 00:14:21,87
a long way to go in our country ladies and
gentlemen our Constitution is young but

163
00:14:21,88 --> 00:14:28,20
it's the world's most progressive It's the
world's most open hearted big spirited

164
00:14:28,21 --> 00:14:34,45
Constitution. And we have to make it work.
One of the ways that we've got to make

165
00:14:34,46 --> 00:14:41,34
it work is through social justice.
Some of you hope to become

166
00:14:41,35 --> 00:14:42,97
wealthy lawyers who hopes to become

167
00:14:42,98 --> 00:14:49,94
a wealthy lawyer. But up your
hands Don't be shy Don't be

168
00:14:49,95 --> 00:14:56,45
shy. Can I tell you this ladies and
gentlemen. Let me tell you something which I

169
00:14:56,46 --> 00:15:02,30
want to I want to tell you very carefully.
There's nothing wrong in wanting

170
00:15:02,62 --> 00:15:09,41
prosperity in your own lives on condition
that you work for it. That's why

171
00:15:09,42 --> 00:15:15,36
corruption is so bad because corruption
is wealth stolen from the public without

172
00:15:15,37 --> 00:15:22,14
any work being done. There's nothing wrong
with wanting to do well and to succeed

173
00:15:22,15 --> 00:15:28,54
and to prosper provided you work
for it. But hear me on this

174
00:15:29,52 --> 00:15:30,21
if you want to be

175
00:15:30,22 --> 00:15:36,42
a lawyer in South Africa. You're going
to have to ensure that the legal system

176
00:15:37,48 --> 00:15:44,28
continues to function. And for the legal
system to continue to function. And to

177
00:15:44,29 --> 00:15:48,74
play the. Course it doesn't
our country it's got to be

178
00:15:48,75 --> 00:15:55,21
a just legal system it's the same dilemma
as the apartheid force regime had

179
00:15:56,17 --> 00:15:57,08
they couldn't enforce

180
00:15:57,25 --> 00:16:02,31
a party through the law unless they allowed
the judges to give some decisions which

181
00:16:02,32 --> 00:16:08,11
were anti-apartheid they couldn't picture
departed unless they allowed the trade

182
00:16:08,13 --> 00:16:14,22
unions in the 1900s and the trade unions
adopted the lawn fought for their rights

183
00:16:14,22 --> 00:16:19,17
through the law through the apartheid legal
system. And the same principle applies

184
00:16:19,18 --> 00:16:24,87
now. We cannot be lawyers we
cannot be lawyers and judges.

185
00:16:26,59 --> 00:16:33,11
Let alone prosperous lawyers and judges
unless we extend the benefits of our

186
00:16:33,18 --> 00:16:39,67
country's prosperity to everyone. The
fundamental principles on which our

187
00:16:39,68 --> 00:16:44,20
Constitution is based. Of the
supreme Esi of the Constitution.

188
00:16:48,03 --> 00:16:54,09
It is the primary source of all values
in our legal system its higher than the

189
00:16:54,10 --> 00:16:57,72
president higher than the judiciary
higher than parliament higher than the

190
00:16:57,73 --> 00:17:02,88
administration Secondly the
separation of powers which is

191
00:17:02,89 --> 00:17:07,59
a balance of power between the arms of
government with the judiciary having

192
00:17:07,60 --> 00:17:14,39
responsibility in the end to pronounce
on the legality of it. And the third

193
00:17:14,40 --> 00:17:19,30
principle is this idea of social justice
because the people who made our

194
00:17:19,31 --> 00:17:25,00
Constitution the first constitutional
assembly which we voted for those of us who

195
00:17:25,01 --> 00:17:29,78
could vote and once and I before they
understood something very important.

196
00:17:32,35 --> 00:17:37,10
It's all very well to say that everyone
has freedom of speech and freedom of

197
00:17:37,11 --> 00:17:41,60
religion and freedom of conscience and
freedom of movement and freedom of

198
00:17:41,61 --> 00:17:48,32
association and freedom of expression. But
all of those beautiful rights me nothing

199
00:17:48,33 --> 00:17:54,94
if you hungry. And I right. Some of you
come from homes where I think people are

200
00:17:54,95 --> 00:18:01,35
still hungry and I right ladies and
gentlemen. So we have to ensure

201
00:18:01,83 --> 00:18:07,75
through our commitment to the law that
the Constitution's commitment to social

202
00:18:07,76 --> 00:18:09,42
justice and equality becomes

203
00:18:09,43 --> 00:18:15,93
a real one once we are on the road to social
justice and equality for everyone for

204
00:18:15,94 --> 00:18:21,06
the poorest of the poor. Because the
legal system is designed to protect the

205
00:18:21,07 --> 00:18:27,56
poorest of the poor once we're on that
path then you can relax and say I'm

206
00:18:27,57 --> 00:18:33,02
entitled to my prosperity and that's why I
say Don't feel bad about it but remember

207
00:18:33,58 --> 00:18:38,76
that it's lawyers your commitment to social
justice is indispensible it's not just

208
00:18:38,77 --> 00:18:41,95
a matter of conscience or
a matter of morality it's

209
00:18:41,96 --> 00:18:46,34
a matter of practical self survival
you will not survive as lawyers if

210
00:18:46,35 --> 00:18:51,06
a legal system goes the way of other legal
systems like in Suozzi land or Zimbabwe

211
00:18:51,94 --> 00:18:55,43
I know there's some people from Zimbabwe
here where the people from Zimbabwe are

212
00:18:56,59 --> 00:19:01,21
someone who capital B Yes don't be shy who
is from Zimbabwe but in general me let

213
00:19:01,22 --> 00:19:03,00
me tell you about somebody it's

214
00:19:03,01 --> 00:19:08,52
a country that shows spectacularly. How
the rule of law has not been implemented

215
00:19:09,05 --> 00:19:15,91
how autocracy and dictatorship. Have
triumphed over the rule of law and the

216
00:19:15,92 --> 00:19:21,53
same happens in Suozzi land which kingdom
Swati is an autocrat hereditary autocrat

217
00:19:21,54 --> 00:19:27,14
with us what he speakers. Don't be shy you
Francis Eylandt I'm not going to ask you

218
00:19:27,15 --> 00:19:32,66
to say anything about Kim So I think you
may be silent. That isn't Gentlemen let me

219
00:19:32,67 --> 00:19:38,69
tell you something. When you speak about
King and Swati and about President Robert

220
00:19:38,70 --> 00:19:44,33
Mugabe during the election. mr.

221
00:19:44,35 --> 00:19:50,42
Julius Malema the head of the
if F. Was reported to have told

222
00:19:50,43 --> 00:19:57,27
a meeting and Pollack Pliny that President
Jacob Zuma was fortunate that he

223
00:19:57,36 --> 00:20:01,08
wasn't sitting on a street corner
selling single cigarettes for

224
00:20:01,09 --> 00:20:07,67
a living because that's what he
should be doing. Don't be shy to

225
00:20:07,68 --> 00:20:13,33
laugh. Can I tell you why you can laugh
ladies and gentlemen because it's

226
00:20:13,37 --> 00:20:19,44
outrageous. It's outrageous. That
anyone can say of the president of

227
00:20:19,45 --> 00:20:21,41
a country that he should be sitting on

228
00:20:21,42 --> 00:20:25,56
a street corner that he's deserves to be
selling some single cigarettes but let me

229
00:20:25,57 --> 00:20:31,71
tell you why I was so proud to hear it I
heard it late night on the radio. On the

230
00:20:31,77 --> 00:20:35,14
ten o'clock seven zero two
news it was the last item.

231
00:20:38,82 --> 00:20:45,52
Across to Serbs of the landmass
of the planet earth Mr Julius

232
00:20:45,53 --> 00:20:51,38
Malema would have been locked up the next
morning in Suozzi land in Zimbabwe in

233
00:20:51,39 --> 00:20:57,54
Botswana prison and comma doesn't like
criticism throughout the rest of Africa

234
00:20:57,55 --> 00:21:03,79
through Russia China the Caucasus pots of
South America two thirds of our planet he

235
00:21:03,80 --> 00:21:10,01
would have been locked up here no one
even noticed it. I'm proud to live in

236
00:21:10,02 --> 00:21:11,37
a democracy under

237
00:21:11,38 --> 00:21:16,78
a constitution we must Imma lemma is free
to say outrageous things about President

238
00:21:16,79 --> 00:21:20,35
Zuma. But the point is

239
00:21:20,36 --> 00:21:25,71
a profound one ladies and gentlemen it's
one that you've got to fight for you've

240
00:21:25,72 --> 00:21:31,35
got to fight for the system of authority
that confers on President Zuma the power

241
00:21:32,39 --> 00:21:35,24
to exercise executive
authority in order to make

242
00:21:35,47 --> 00:21:40,29
a constitution real and just but you've
also got to fight. For the right of

243
00:21:40,30 --> 00:21:45,35
citizens you disagree with him to be
able to criticize him frontally and to

244
00:21:45,36 --> 00:21:50,46
President zumas credits and the agencies
credit there was no follow up I didn't

245
00:21:50,47 --> 00:21:55,74
read about it anywhere for some elements
free to make those statements and he's

246
00:21:55,75 --> 00:21:58,99
free to speak out his mind and no one laid

247
00:21:59,00 --> 00:22:04,50
a charge against him no one sought to
change the law to prosecute him. That is

248
00:22:04,51 --> 00:22:09,35
something worth fighting for ladies and
gentlemen but the most important thing.

249
00:22:10,46 --> 00:22:16,87
That our Constitution sees that equality
has to be real. And you are the

250
00:22:16,91 --> 00:22:23,32
agents. Of constitutional supremacist
You are the agents of separation of

251
00:22:23,33 --> 00:22:29,71
powers you are the agents of social justice
you are the agents of constitutional

252
00:22:29,73 --> 00:22:34,11
equality become unlucky for me it was

253
00:22:34,12 --> 00:22:39,39
a clear cut up in. Yemen
a cue to to make it work

254
00:22:39,39 --> 00:22:42,61
a lot and yes the art and there's

255
00:22:42,62 --> 00:22:47,95
a lot to enjoy and to delight in the law
ladies and gentlemen. I want to tell you

256
00:22:47,97 --> 00:22:53,06
a bit about. Social neck anomic rights and
this is the lost part of what I wanna

257
00:22:53,06 --> 00:22:57,22
say it's going to take about another
five or ten minutes but I want to draw

258
00:22:57,23 --> 00:23:03,82
together what I've been saying to do you
by mentioning one of the rights. To social

259
00:23:03,83 --> 00:23:09,16
and economic justice and it's the right
to health care and it's one of the rights

260
00:23:09,67 --> 00:23:14,32
which our Constitution embodies which makes
it different from the Constitution of

261
00:23:14,33 --> 00:23:18,95
Canada the constitution of
Australia the European Charter

262
00:23:18,96 --> 00:23:25,75
a convention on human rights. The Constitution
of the United States of America. We

263
00:23:25,76 --> 00:23:25,90
have

264
00:23:25,91 --> 00:23:32,10
a constitution which as I've explained is
based on the principle of the empty stomach

265
00:23:32,10 --> 00:23:38,78
. That the law has to cater for the
empty stomach as well as for the

266
00:23:38,79 --> 00:23:44,10
first order of rights and that's why we
have the right of access to housing the

267
00:23:44,11 --> 00:23:48,81
right of access to health care the right
to education the right to Social Security

268
00:23:48,82 --> 00:23:55,68
the right of access to food. And the one
I want to use to close off the loss

269
00:23:55,69 --> 00:24:01,63
part of my talk is the right to health
care because just as we were becoming

270
00:24:01,64 --> 00:24:07,51
a democracy just as Luanda
was experience the horrific

271
00:24:08,24 --> 00:24:14,31
experiencing the horrific genocide
of 100 for. The AIDS epidemic

272
00:24:15,19 --> 00:24:20,61
was flooding into South Africa one thousand
ninety national prevalence of below two

273
00:24:20,62 --> 00:24:22,04
per cent not ninety five

274
00:24:22,44 --> 00:24:28,57
a national prevalence of five per cent
as President Mandela took office. And I

275
00:24:28,58 --> 00:24:35,07
mention this because twenty one years
later we have what the epidemiologists

276
00:24:35,09 --> 00:24:35,62
call

277
00:24:35,85 --> 00:24:41,85
a maturing pedantic and immature if idem
iq means that almost everyone here knows

278
00:24:41,85 --> 00:24:46,67
someone who has died of AIDS and I
write put up your hands if you've got

279
00:24:46,95 --> 00:24:50,53
a family member or member of the community
who's died of AIDS Don't be shy that is

280
00:24:50,53 --> 00:24:56,52
in general and we all have
it we have lost. Well over

281
00:24:56,56 --> 00:25:03,40
a million or maybe two million people in
our country to the AIDS epidemic. And what

282
00:25:03,41 --> 00:25:09,94
happened in one ninety four. Is that
there was an intersection of this new

283
00:25:09,95 --> 00:25:15,58
promising aspirational legal system and
the dreadfulness of the AIDS epidemic.

284
00:25:18,25 --> 00:25:18,53
And in

285
00:25:18,54 --> 00:25:25,31
a completely unexpected way the rule of
law and the courts and lawyers played

286
00:25:25,32 --> 00:25:31,24
a pivotal pot in our national response
to AIDS. Because when President

287
00:25:31,25 --> 00:25:38,23
a Mandela left office in 1909 his
successor President and Becky had

288
00:25:39,55 --> 00:25:45,79
very very very alarming views on
the causes and treatment of AIDS

289
00:25:46,78 --> 00:25:49,11
he appeared to be sympathetic to

290
00:25:49,12 --> 00:25:55,05
a tiny fraction. Of looneys who. Queried.

291
00:25:56,67 --> 00:26:03,28
HIV is the cause of AIDS whether you can
test for HIV with you can treat AIDS. And

292
00:26:03,29 --> 00:26:10,27
the reason for his doing that was stigma
this disease is the most stigmatized

293
00:26:10,27 --> 00:26:16,25
disease in human history it's stigmatized
ladies and gentlemen even though it is

294
00:26:16,26 --> 00:26:21,78
now medically manageable and though
that because often came out as

295
00:26:21,79 --> 00:26:27,98
a gay man in the 180s I became infected
with a trophy and I'm living with

296
00:26:27,99 --> 00:26:34,96
a child. And in one 107. I was
very very very sick with AIDS.

297
00:26:36,21 --> 00:26:42,58
And I was going to die. But I
was very lucky. I started on

298
00:26:42,59 --> 00:26:48,92
antiretroviral therapy in November 1997.
It'll be eighteen years at the end of this

299
00:26:48,93 --> 00:26:54,93
year and I take three tablets once
every morning. And they're keeping

300
00:26:54,94 --> 00:26:59,23
a very very fit and healthy and I'm very
grateful for that ladies and gentlemen I

301
00:26:59,24 --> 00:27:03,55
wake up every morning thinking what
an extraordinary thing it is to be

302
00:27:03,84 --> 00:27:09,03
a conscious human being that is wonderful
isn't it ladies and gentlemen but there

303
00:27:09,04 --> 00:27:13,02
was a terrible struggle
I started the drugs at

304
00:27:13,03 --> 00:27:16,85
a time when I was still too
scared to talk about my own

305
00:27:16,86 --> 00:27:22,23
a child. But when I was
recovered and after a woman in

306
00:27:22,24 --> 00:27:27,32
a lousy township called good I mean he
died I determined to speak out about

307
00:27:27,33 --> 00:27:33,61
discrimination and stigma and about
treatment. But at the very same time

308
00:27:34,24 --> 00:27:40,90
prison to Mbeki was saying no we're not
going to offer treatment it's toxic We

309
00:27:40,91 --> 00:27:44,38
don't know if it helps we don't know what
the causes of AIDS are we need further

310
00:27:44,39 --> 00:27:49,27
study we need further investigation I didn't
need further investigation ladies and

311
00:27:49,28 --> 00:27:54,40
gentlemen I was going to be dead
the mean survival time. For

312
00:27:54,41 --> 00:27:58,02
a forty one year old man. With

313
00:27:58,03 --> 00:28:04,35
a full symptoms of AIDS I had. With
medical care and a home as I had in

314
00:28:04,36 --> 00:28:08,05
a good job as I had the means available
time is thirty months two and

315
00:28:08,06 --> 00:28:13,02
a half years I should have been dead in
June 2000 Well it's nearly fifteen years

316
00:28:13,03 --> 00:28:17,79
later I didn't need further study ladies
and gentlemen and the Treatment Action

317
00:28:17,80 --> 00:28:24,42
Campaign. Was organized and started to
tackle the question of drug prices and they

318
00:28:24,43 --> 00:28:29,67
won that battle young people like yourselves
from the townships and the rural areas

319
00:28:29,68 --> 00:28:35,23
of our country. They took on the international
pharmaceutical companies and they

320
00:28:35,24 --> 00:28:41,60
won. Minister what's Well lady has
just negotiated the next tranche of

321
00:28:41,61 --> 00:28:47,55
antiretroviral treatment provision for
less than 100 Rand per person per months.

322
00:28:49,25 --> 00:28:51,84

BUT BUT BUT BUT BUT BUT

326
00:29:08,82 --> 00:29:14,79
BUT BUT BUT present to
Mbeki refused powerful man

327
00:29:15,41 --> 00:29:16,31
a proud man

328
00:29:17,03 --> 00:29:23,58
a man who wanted to rescue our continent
from centuries of degradation from racism

329
00:29:23,59 --> 00:29:24,40
and colonialism

330
00:29:24,41 --> 00:29:30,70
a man who wanted to restore the humanity
of Africa the African renaissance the

331
00:29:30,71 --> 00:29:35,61
dignity of blackness he made
a terrible mistake. About

332
00:29:35,62 --> 00:29:42,39
a hive. But the Treatment
Action Campaign. Used all its

333
00:29:42,43 --> 00:29:48,75
constitutional rights. None of them was
over thirty five ladies and gentlemen Zach

334
00:29:48,76 --> 00:29:53,83
you have met all of the leaders were young
people like yourselves young determined

335
00:29:53,87 --> 00:29:57,70
angry idealistic smart people
who knew that they had

336
00:29:57,71 --> 00:30:01,89
a Constitution that the right to assemble
that the right to march and they marched

337
00:30:02,20 --> 00:30:06,54
on the Union Buildings on take notes on
polymers they marched on the drug companies

338
00:30:06,79 --> 00:30:11,78
they marched in they'll space and they
marched and Durban every provincial capital

339
00:30:12,90 --> 00:30:18,47
but they had the strongest right of all
which was Section twenty seven one which

340
00:30:18,48 --> 00:30:23,85
gives everyone the right of access to
health care. And Section twenty seven To

341
00:30:24,26 --> 00:30:26,83
which says that the government must take

342
00:30:26,84 --> 00:30:31,82
a more reasonable measures legislative
than other measures to ensure the right of

343
00:30:31,83 --> 00:30:36,66
access to health care and they said.
But President and Becky was not being

344
00:30:36,82 --> 00:30:39,69
reasonable. And you had

345
00:30:39,70 --> 00:30:44,16
a judge in Pretoria who
looked at all the evidence.

346
00:30:47,21 --> 00:30:51,38
And he could judge dispassionately between
the Minister of Health president to

347
00:30:51,39 --> 00:30:56,44
Mbeki on the one side and the Treatment
Action Campaign and Chris or two and the

348
00:30:56,45 --> 00:31:01,40
South African Council of Churches and all
the organizations the pediatric medical

349
00:31:01,41 --> 00:31:07,56
association that brought the application
and he found for the applicants. And

350
00:31:07,57 --> 00:31:13,30
President Debakey took the case on appeal
to the constitutional court before I got

351
00:31:13,31 --> 00:31:20,21
there but I was watching. Because I knew
that these drugs were giving me life every

352
00:31:20,22 --> 00:31:26,17
day and five hundred thousand people every
year were dying of AIDS by the time

353
00:31:26,18 --> 00:31:26,77
President to be

354
00:31:26,78 --> 00:31:33,01
a key took office in 1909. And the court
ruled the court looked at all the evidence

355
00:31:33,02 --> 00:31:37,91
and it ruled unanimously that president
to take his program on AIDS was not

356
00:31:37,92 --> 00:31:43,77
reasonable it gave an order that he had
to start making anti-retroviral treatment

357
00:31:43,78 --> 00:31:47,64
available. And the result was that

358
00:31:48,01 --> 00:31:54,37
a little while later it took some time
because the T A C is court orders don't just

359
00:31:54,38 --> 00:31:58,99
happen ladies and gentlemen they need
activists to enforce them good lawyers good

360
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:03,97
activists and honest politicians they
also need courageous judges to give that

361
00:32:03,98 --> 00:32:09,20
order to the half year after
the T A C judgment we've got

362
00:32:09,21 --> 00:32:13,90
a national treatment program ladies and
gentlemen and now we have the biggest

363
00:32:14,28 --> 00:32:19,35
anti-retroviral treatment program anywhere
in the world nearly three million people

364
00:32:19,36 --> 00:32:21,32
like myself are receiving

365
00:32:21,33 --> 00:32:25,89
a of these from the public sector and to
go back to the Zimbabwe and Suozzi land

366
00:32:25,90 --> 00:32:31,52
issue and the Rwandan issue I'm
very proud. That when you go to

367
00:32:31,53 --> 00:32:35,97
a clinic and OS to be tested and
when you ask for antiretrovirals

368
00:32:35,98 --> 00:32:39,87
a clinic they don't ask for your possible
they don't ask your papers they don't ask

369
00:32:39,88 --> 00:32:44,39
your permanent residence they sign you up
I'm so proud of that that is in gentlemen

370
00:32:44,61 --> 00:32:48,76
because it recognizes argue manity and
it recognizes the proper principles of

371
00:32:48,77 --> 00:32:55,70
public health but none of that.
None of that ladies and gentlemen

372
00:32:55,98 --> 00:33:02,43
would we have had if we didn't have
principled activists principled activists who

373
00:33:02,44 --> 00:33:06,52
use the law principle
activists to formulated

374
00:33:06,58 --> 00:33:13,17
a good case with good evidence and good
strategies. And took it before the

375
00:33:13,18 --> 00:33:19,08
courts and the courts were independent and
the courts respected President to Mbeki

376
00:33:19,09 --> 00:33:26,06
like I respect President Zuma. But my
duty to the law comes before any respect

377
00:33:26,07 --> 00:33:30,66
I have for the president of this country
because that president he or she is

378
00:33:30,67 --> 00:33:35,23
subordinate to the law and the judges gave
an order and to President and break his

379
00:33:35,24 --> 00:33:40,51
credit he bowed his head
before the rule of law.

380
00:33:42,63 --> 00:33:44,65
And the history books will
credit president and be

381
00:33:44,66 --> 00:33:49,54
a key for that unlucky him Swati unlike
President Mugabe president can be

382
00:33:49,55 --> 00:33:54,06
a key bodies head and that's case the
Treatment Action Campaign case which you will

383
00:33:54,07 --> 00:33:59,00
read is the most dramatic case that
is stablished the supremacist of the

384
00:33:59,01 --> 00:34:05,39
Constitution the primacy of the law the
Exige ability of social and economic rights

385
00:34:06,13 --> 00:34:10,34
and the independence of the judiciary but
it could not have done that ladies and

386
00:34:10,35 --> 00:34:14,63
gentlemen and this is my
final point. Without you.

387
00:34:18,35 --> 00:34:24,26
You are young. You are committed to the
law you are interested. We live in

388
00:34:24,27 --> 00:34:30,83
a time of poverty of xenophobia of
differences of racial tensions.

389
00:34:32,14 --> 00:34:32,61
But we have

390
00:34:32,62 --> 00:34:38,89
a system of values. Which over the past
twenty one years we have made to work.

391
00:34:40,61 --> 00:34:45,30
Lawyers young people like yourselves and
activists have shown that the Constitution

392
00:34:45,31 --> 00:34:52,17
works. We have values and norms and principles
in the Constitution that show us the

393
00:34:52,18 --> 00:34:58,74
way forward to all our problems.
But it's up to you. With all your

394
00:34:58,75 --> 00:35:03,07
commitment and idealism and all your
truthfulness and all your desire for

395
00:35:03,08 --> 00:35:08,04
prosperity. And all your wish for

396
00:35:08,05 --> 00:35:13,04
a just and dignified South Africa it's
up to you to make it work thank you very

397
00:35:13,05 --> 00:35:13,45
much.
