1
00:00:00,07 --> 00:00:01,61
The.

2
00:00:10,57 --> 00:00:17,18
Put. A lot. Milk. When
you can even argue yet

3
00:00:17,77 --> 00:00:24,05
you know this push to talk of police to
hold. Things like Unlike so rotten running

4
00:00:24,05 --> 00:00:26,55
. Because of the record this is

5
00:00:26,56 --> 00:00:32,26
a test case scenario from the field here
Yeah exactly I read that it's time for

6
00:00:33,18 --> 00:00:33,49
going to have

7
00:00:33,53 --> 00:00:40,51
a whole new world Oh my so so what's
going on I think what's going on

8
00:00:40,52 --> 00:00:45,50
I don't think it's I mean that. I'm so
fuckin hung I would just come back from

9
00:00:45,51 --> 00:00:51,10
lunch with the police here.
And tell me from box.

10
00:00:52,79 --> 00:00:55,54
That I couldn't make it this
time but I think the waiter is

11
00:00:55,55 --> 00:01:01,97
a fine man that we can say Yeah so you get
it I got onto it yeah yeah good man yeah

12
00:01:01,98 --> 00:01:06,30
come along I haven't Yeah we're looking at
you called me up my earlier and gave me

13
00:01:06,31 --> 00:01:12,54
a lady and I had no idea I just went
with it you know he's pretty good yeah

14
00:01:13,38 --> 00:01:13,72
you know I did

15
00:01:13,73 --> 00:01:16,86
a bit of welfare talk back fifty on others
I might just get around already going on

16
00:01:16,87 --> 00:01:22,91
and fifty miles I'll take something then
and you. And and put you bought last week

17
00:01:23,15 --> 00:01:30,13
that he held. After you really look
like yeah absolutely when we put beyond

18
00:01:30,21 --> 00:01:30,44
we got

19
00:01:30,45 --> 00:01:34,34
a pretty good heads up on the desk about
an hour or so we were all on the back

20
00:01:34,35 --> 00:01:40,38
about what we'd seen with him the big Asian
put it sort of structure on and we just

21
00:01:40,39 --> 00:01:43,82
went with it yeah exactly that's all we
can that we sent messages and the Asian

22
00:01:43,91 --> 00:01:49,80
kids and I think it's an honour. And to be
honest so in those you know we just keep

23
00:01:49,81 --> 00:01:54,04
on using that and you know compliance don't
seem to have any idea that we're using

24
00:01:54,05 --> 00:02:00,18
you know. Keep on doing. That my father
enough to make money in this market anyway

25
00:02:00,19 --> 00:02:04,94
so we just have to stick together and do
whatever we can do to keep that little

26
00:02:05,21 --> 00:02:09,100
going along and we all know playing field
around an example and all. Stuff they

27
00:02:10,01 --> 00:02:14,57
take they got no idea what's going on now
and they were inside like exactly I mean

28
00:02:14,58 --> 00:02:19,71
to be honest with you know the central banks
and still think be running around with

29
00:02:19,72 --> 00:02:24,94
a smile and stay there after I've got
the rock to go on here once I think.

30
00:02:26,82 --> 00:02:28,20
You know what you just give me

31
00:02:28,67 --> 00:02:34,93
a call you next time. Now you can you
recount. The reason lower realize

32
00:02:35,52 --> 00:02:42,44
that you can't have the. Only way to play
the game so you know well if it's us

33
00:02:42,45 --> 00:02:48,26
against them isn't it. And you know what
they felt they done online said adding I

34
00:02:48,27 --> 00:02:53,07
mean to be on the line is all work with the
bank yeah you know right now I call it

35
00:02:53,08 --> 00:02:58,07
the margin in the colic after service I
don't know really what they do now but to

36
00:02:58,08 --> 00:03:01,93
be honest I don't think we make
any money now and they talk

37
00:03:01,94 --> 00:03:06,99
a good book you know that's right tight
in the pipeline the prise. You know what

38
00:03:07,00 --> 00:03:11,98
it's like you know what if oh yeah yeah
yeah I've been on the right side I was just

39
00:03:11,99 --> 00:03:18,63
kind of the dark side. I think.
We all of the dark side.

40
00:03:22,17 --> 00:03:22,30
Had

41
00:03:22,31 --> 00:03:26,39
a bad view up and they can we did so pretty
good it's pretty it's not that all this

42
00:03:26,77 --> 00:03:31,47
good could get used to this sort of where
we are and I think the big garden in our

43
00:03:31,48 --> 00:03:38,23
town. You know well. You know now no one
can really hear me you've got one half

44
00:03:38,24 --> 00:03:43,47
a dozen people sitting
around. Yet now look like

45
00:03:43,48 --> 00:03:50,45
a dork happy or confined Well it's.
Not. That we've got everything in

46
00:03:50,46 --> 00:03:54,02
there that they always I think you know
cut it all off then all that and I think

47
00:03:54,03 --> 00:03:58,71
again it was with the. We were.

48
00:04:01,32 --> 00:04:06,48
I think we don't you know I'm not
sure that. I think you've got

49
00:04:06,49 --> 00:04:13,19
a time when you want second. No it's you

50
00:04:13,20 --> 00:04:19,22
know I haven't we haven't I
know you haven't seen it that.

51
00:04:22,01 --> 00:04:28,90
We've only been here that. I can't
remember the last time I spoke for

52
00:04:28,91 --> 00:04:35,58
ten minutes or telephone. BAKLEY right
so when you got home for the weekend

53
00:04:36,50 --> 00:04:41,36
no matter I reckon I don't see that meeting
sorry other like that happening oh yeah

54
00:04:41,37 --> 00:04:48,13
I know you enjoy that feeling for that
and you. Can't get one of the bookies to

55
00:04:48,14 --> 00:04:54,77
thank you have been allowing actually Iraqi
pay that off the deaf and. So on the

56
00:04:54,78 --> 00:04:59,60
other side of things. Yeah exactly I
mean you know they scratch your back you

57
00:04:59,61 --> 00:05:04,83
scratch their. FACE. So the next sound on
this is going to be missing like I mean

58
00:05:05,53 --> 00:05:12,52
the fact. I think about the few
gaps in that one. I think you have

59
00:05:12,56 --> 00:05:18,93
some legal opinions. But if you had
wobbling that it'd be able to be recorded.

60
00:05:21,43 --> 00:05:24,77
At the bar the way we had we had a
few inquiries Smalling for a couple

61
00:05:24,78 --> 00:05:29,53
a couple of public eases want to know what
was going on cable if you see much of

62
00:05:29,54 --> 00:05:35,27
falling on and up and that if you had like
that nobody can anything anything like

63
00:05:35,28 --> 00:05:37,42
that to the options guys
and it's and that had

64
00:05:37,43 --> 00:05:42,09
a few few calls. Well I wanted
to be honest because there's

65
00:05:42,10 --> 00:05:44,47
a guy said he might have
an interest in just shy of

66
00:05:44,48 --> 00:05:50,60
a long and later on but. You know he
would want to know what we saw and to be

67
00:05:50,61 --> 00:05:56,28
honest cable not my strong point I just
made something up as usual but you know

68
00:05:56,40 --> 00:06:00,42
this place I think the centre of the
universe is in the UK so I probably know the

69
00:06:00,43 --> 00:06:01,08
good in fact I'm

70
00:06:01,09 --> 00:06:07,09
a long life yeah exactly have you got
much cooking in the fix for surviving on

71
00:06:07,94 --> 00:06:08,27
there is

72
00:06:08,28 --> 00:06:12,94
a bit around and I've heard that he's
been saying it to Iran it is going to be

73
00:06:12,95 --> 00:06:15,66
sending up quite a bit of a time quite

74
00:06:15,67 --> 00:06:21,98
a bit in the you know I. Suppose some
decent. Which way you could phone way I'll

75
00:06:21,99 --> 00:06:25,80
give you a shout I think it's going
to be on the right hand side I think

76
00:06:25,81 --> 00:06:30,53
a whole lot of if I get some come through
it we normally get ours in the next half

77
00:06:30,54 --> 00:06:35,37
an hour ago come through on the show you
know you can do it you know you some

78
00:06:35,38 --> 00:06:40,95
decent it together with that's right and
just sort of. Didn't up the cost of

79
00:06:40,96 --> 00:06:45,82
service at the end I think well you know
if it works and you know will you can buy

80
00:06:45,83 --> 00:06:50,22
me dinner next time next time I'll do it
and you can buy me and I'll buy you dinner

81
00:06:50,23 --> 00:06:52,10

82
00:06:52,11 --> 00:06:56,50
a few more names on the go flight back
running will have to come up with small code

83
00:06:56,51 --> 00:07:00,97
words I think is I think these wankers who
are listening to our conversations are

84
00:07:00,98 --> 00:07:07,18
getting used to the. Fact that they
get the new book out scrambled up.

85
00:07:08,37 --> 00:07:10,59
WILL Well we've next time we go out for

86
00:07:10,60 --> 00:07:17,29
a beer we can sort and so on that old
word and I mean and what we were using we

87
00:07:17,30 --> 00:07:21,62
care about what happens to the work of the
granting of the idea that you know that

88
00:07:21,63 --> 00:07:25,37
I fear that ageing out on this mine and I
love you know yeah they do like we turn

and you know you don't think it's an

110
00:09:19,69 --> 00:09:23,29
a ten minute mile and I fell
and I think I'd only got

111
00:09:23,30 --> 00:09:28,66
a lot to my wife longer than ten minutes.
Early for that another glass of wine

112

exactly that's that's what's emitting

113
00:09:31,57 --> 00:09:35,95
a glass of water and I think I might have

early when I get home tonight to me in the
togs that no count. From the telly with

115

00:09:55,25 --> 00:10:01,63
